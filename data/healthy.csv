Kala Chana Cheap and Very Healthy Option,"Kala chana is also known as black chickpeas or black garbanzo beans. It is mostly famous in Asian countries such as Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Burma, Pakistan. It is rich in protein, fiber, iron, calcium, and vitamins. With its nutritious value, kala chana also provides the best curry taste for vegetarians. It will cost around $1 for 1 pound depending on where you buy. This dish will be the best option for vegetarians. Below is the recipe.

  
***Instructions:***  
Firstly, soak black chana with water overnight or the whole day.  
Wash and the clean chana 2-3 times properly with the water.  
Add oil in the pressure cooker on medium flame.   
Put cumin seeds and after few minutes when seeds start to splutter add chopped onion, ginger-garlic paste and green chili. Stir it for the next 5 minutes.  
Add chopped tomatoes and all the above-mentioned spices. Stir it well for another 5 minutes.  
Add the soaked kala chana and stir it.  
After chana is fried well put 1.5 cups of water to the pressure cooker.  
Close the lid of a pressure cooker and cook it until you hear three whistles.   
Now close the heat and let the pressure release naturally from the cooker.  
   
After all, the air is gone, open the lid and add lemon juice, stir it and put cilantro on top to garnish.  
You can serve kala chana curry with rice or roti or naan.

What to do this leftover celery?,"Hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I recently wanted to make a vegetarian couscous, so for the soup I bought some celery (among other things obviously!)

Problem is, while I only needed 2 stalks and some leaves, my supermarket only sells the whole celery (image from wiki :P ). As I also make bolognese sauce, which requires a few celery stalks, and always end up throwing away a bunch of celery.

So, I would appreciate some suggestions as to what to do with all the leftover celery. I'm actually not that huge a fan of live celery, so just putting it in a salad (if that's a thing) is a no-go.

Making a cheaper meal-replacement?,"I'm trying to switch from decades of malnutrition to eating healthy, though at the same time I'm dealing with a small budget and anorexia. Due to the latter, I usually have trouble actually eating, especially since my digestive tract is a bit trashed. I've found Soylent and other such drinks to be great because they give me all my nutrients and shoot my calorie count up 400 before I can back out. On the downside, at $3 a bottle, I'm only drinking one a day, so I'm only getting 20% of what I need.

A few years ago I volunteered somewhere that made these powders that were sent to really poor countries to provide complete nutrition at a very low cost. Given I don't feel hunger and hate all food anyway, being filling or yummy isn't much of a concern. My plan is to throw a bunch of stuff in a blender and suck it down, but I have no idea what will blend, what I need to be nutritious (all of the actual foods look like the amount of nutrients per serving is so low I may as well just keep popping a few multivitamins a day), and if I can make it tolerable. I'm also strictly vegetarian, though I imagine throwing meat in a blender and saving it isn't a cheap or smart idea anyway.",EatCheapAndHealthy

Beat the Heat: you can save some dollars by making your own Iced Tea,"With the hot weather we are currently experiencing we find ourselves constantly reaching for water to stay hydrated. To change it up a bit, I've been making a couple of gallons of iced tea each week for my family. I bought a box of 100 bags of green tea at the dollar store and it is stretching really far (you can't beat a penny a bag!)  Most people on here probably already do this or know about it, but I thought I'd share for those who may not know and are trying to save some money.  (It personally took me an embarrassingly long time to realize this, Lol.)

To make homemade iced tea I fill a large pot halfway (approx 8 cups) with water to boil. Once it is boiling I turn off the heat and put 4 to 6 tea bags in the pot of water to brew. Once it sits a while (the longer you leave them in the water, the stronger the tea) I take the tea bags out and add sugar in and mix it until the sugar is desolved. Then I add in some cool water, approx 8 more cups. Once the tea cools, I pour it into a pitcher or into containers (I use glass mason jars just cause I have them around) and then refrigerate until cold. You can also add in some lemon slices, or any other fruit, before refrigerating to make it a flavored iced tea. 

I dont know what a gallon of iced tea costs in most areas, but I'd say it's a win to make a gallon of iced tea for less than a dime. ☺

Do you make your own iced tea? Please share how you do it- I'm always looking for more ideas. Thanks in advance.",EatCheapAndHealthy
Chocolate Peanut Butter Mug Cake,"I saw a post reply recently that mentioned how great mug cakes are for a one-serving sweet tooth satisfier! I have a recipe I have been using and tweaking for more than 5 years now for good reason. It's delicious! 

Chocolate Peanut Butter Mug Cake:

- 3 tbsp. flour (I use gluten free flour blend)

- 2 tbsp. sugar

- 1 1/2 tbsp. cocoa powder

- 1/4 tsp. baking powder

- 3 tbsp. milk

- 1 1/2 tbsp. vegetable oil

- 1 tbsp. peanut butter (smooth or chunky)


Powdered Sugar Glaze (if desired):

- 1/4 cup powdered/confectioner' sugar

- 3 tbsp. water


Spray a small amount of nonstick cooking spray into a large coffee cup that can be microwaved. 

Whisk dry ingredients in the mug, add wet ingredients. Mix well and pop in microwave. I usually cook mine for 1 minute and 10 seconds, but adjust for your microwave wattage. 

Pull out the mug using an oven mitt! Will be hot! 

If desired, mix powdered sugar and water to make a yummy glaze and pour over immediately after microwaving. Dig in!",EatCheapAndHealthy

"Can anyone help me with a high protein, very low effort diet?","So I’ve decided to start going to the gym again. About two months ago, I started going, and I didn’t skip a day until about a month in, when my girlfriend dumped me. Since then, I’ve felt too down to go back, but I want to get back into it again, especially after I’ve noticed that after a month straight if not going and eating crap I’ve lost the majority of my progress.

When I went last, I didn’t change my diet up too much. All I did was make a shake in the morning instead of eating a cheese sandwich. Every other thing I ate was still unhealthy junk.

My main issue with things like this is that I am very, very lazy. Even 10 minutes to make a shake in the morning, when I used to go to the gym, was a lot of effort to me, which I really understand it’s not that much, but I can just never get into it. I can’t even cook meat on the stove because it takes too long in my head, which I understand it’s really not, but that’s just how I am. Because I can’t get into it, I always end up quitting on whenever I get a health kick. That’s why I need something very, very low effort. If I don’t have that, there’s no doubt in my mind I’ll just quit on it, as I have with the other 6-7 health kicks I’ve had in the past. I would pretty much have to stick to a microwave only diet, which I’m fine with, but I can’t find foods that will work with.

For breakfast, I’ve figured out that I will just buy a pack of Muscle Milks, which will get me a lot of protein and is already available for me to have as soon as I’m ready to have it.

Lunch and dinner are a bigger issue for me though. I want to have very high amounts of protein, but I can’t think or find anything that is very easy that will let me do that. I think that sandwiches or wraps would work very well, effort wise, for lunch, but I can’t seem to figure out healthy, high protein options. For dinner, I’m practically lost.

If anyone can help me out, I would really appreciate it.",EatCheapAndHealthy
How To Make CREAMY Pinto Beans (Like They Come In Cans) WITHOUT Tons Of Extra Ingredients?,"Title is pretty self-explanatory. LOVE canned pinto beans, but whenever I make my own, the creaminess is nowhere near the same. I look online, and all I see is different recipes. Add chili, this sauce, that sauce, this ingredient, that one. Those are fine and all, but not for my goals. I'm NOT trying to add calories, and I'm NOT trying to add expensive ingredients to my beans. The whole point of pinto beans is that they're CHEAP AND HEALTHY.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's the method. Maybe make them in a crock-pot for a more creamy taste? I dunno.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if I do get the desired creaminess, I don't want to be cooking it daily. Simply don't have the time, so I cook in bulk. I'll stick it in my fridge, take some out each day, and reheat it, but it always tastes pretty bad.

I got a pressure cooker and haven't used it much. What are cheap and healthy ingredients I can get that will go for any dinner?,"For breakfast, I really enjoy quinoa + eggs + greek yogurt or guacamole depending on the cost.

For dinner though, what should I get (ex. carbs sauces spices meats) that can go into any meal? Am I safe to just buy different noodles, different canned beans, different rices, canned tomatoes, ground beef/turkey and chicken breasts/thi ighs? 

Is there an oything else that you'd recommend for a staple? I don't necessarily want a grocery list because that will be different for everyone, I just want single items that can pair well together (like a noodle can go with any meat, or beans can go with chicken rice etc) to make solid, complete and filling meals for dinner.


Ideally I'd like my grocery shopping list is something like a few cans of tomatoes, canned kidney beans, canned black beans, pinto beans, ground turkey beef, chicken, different pasta sauce, salsa, curry, etc.

This way I can effectively have the same meal of meat + carbs just different flavors. If you'd highly recommend me throwing in a few bags of frozen veggies I can do that too....",EatCheapAndHealthy

"Sushi. No, really.","This is probably entirely dependent on your grocery store, so mileage may vary, but my roommate and I have found that we can make decent sushi for a crazy cheap price. 

For proof, here's how the ingredients stack up.

Sushi rice:    
A big bag of rice, some sugar, salt, and rice vinegar is all you need to make [Alton Brown's recipe](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/sushi-rice-recipe-1944633.amp). I buy a huge bag of rice from a local Korean grocery store for 20 bucks and it lasts me and my roommates months, and the rice vinegar was like 5 bucks for having more than enough to dick around with Asian recipes over the summer. I'll ignore the cost of sugar and salt because let's be real you've probably got them anyways. 

The sushi itself:    
Mock crab, seaweed wraps for sushi, and a cucumber were the main part, also some sesame seeds for a little bit of extra flair. We made 8 rolls in total and ended up running out of a five dollar thing of mock crab, using 90% of a small cucumber that was about a dollar, and the seaweed and sesame seeds were 6 dollars for 10 sheets and 3 dollars for a pouch respectively. We also bought a rolling mat for four bucks. 

It was about 20 bucks to get setup to make sushi, but without the rolling mat it's more like 15 dollars to feed the two of us sushi two nights in a row. Just add practice and all of the sudden you've got a cool dinner.",EatCheapAndHealthy

Cheap DIY breakfast sandwich,"I'm a big fan of egg McMuffins, but my waistline and my budget can't afford a daily trip to McD. So I make them myself in the office kitchen most days for breakfast. My local grocery store does $5 Monday sales and they usually include a selected deli meat and cheese for $5/lb. I'll pick up half a pound of each and it will last me about 2 weeks. English muffins are about $3 for 6 and eggs $2 for a dozen. That works out to about $13 for 12 sandwiches, $1.09/sandwich. Even if you can't get it all for as cheap as I do, it's way healthier than McD and fresher than the frozen food isle sandwiches. 

Ingredients:
- English Muffin 
- Slice of deli cheese 
- 2 slices of deli meat
- 1 egg 
- Salt and pepper 
- Butter (optional)

Instructions 
- Pop the English muffin in the toaster
- Crack an egg in a microwave safe mug, add salt and pepper to taste. Microwave for 30 seconds (may vary depending on microwaves) I like to then run a knife around the edge to prevent it from sticking. Microwave another 15 seconds until the yolks is set (I like my egg fully cooked, microwave for less if you like it runny). 
- Take the muffin out of the toaster, butter if you like, then split the cheese in half, one for each muffin slice.
- Top with egg (should be perfectly round from the mug), deli meat, and the other cheese/muffin. 
- Microwave for 10 seconds to get the cheese melty.",EatCheapAndHealthy

Then, every night before bed, I guess I will take out two portions and let them defrost in the refrigerator.

Quick Corn Chowder,"I stumbled upon this delicious chowder idea one day when I decided to stretch a can of corn into a dinner for four. It requires only one can of corn for four servings (or 2-3 cobs of fresh corn if desired).

First time ever sharing a recipe so hope its easy enough to follow

I love anything that's curried, but to make a proper one from scratch takes a while and a lot of ingredients.

I watched an Indian street food vendor make this in minutes and it tasted amazing. I watched him step by step and then tried it at home....its now a weekly go to meal for us as its just so quick and easy its prepped and cooked in about 7-8 minutes, as well as being pretty healthy and super tasty. Good at anytime of the day and comes in at around £1 ($1.20) per serving. 

&amp;#x200B;

 You will need...

Oil of preference.

2 Eggs

1 can of Tomatoes or about 4 fresh ones diced small. (fresh is best, tinned are quicker)

1 half tsp of tomato puree.

1 small or half an onion. (Diced) fine

2 big cloves of garlic. (Crushed)

A thumb tip size piece of ginger. (Grated)

A red or green chilli. (Deseeded and Chopped Fine)

1 tsp Curry Powder

1/2 tsp Chilli powder.

Coriander/Cilantro (optional)

Salt and pepper to taste.

&amp;#x200B;

Instructions:

&amp;#x200B;

(I use the biggest frying pan I have for this as you need quite a bit of space.)

&amp;#x200B;

1 - Heat about a tablespoon of oil in a  non stick pan on a high heat, you want the pan very hot before adding anything.

&amp;#x200B;

2 -  Break and whisk 2 eggs, throw them into you pan to make a thin omelette. Once all of the liquid      turns solid, roll the omelette up with a pallet knife and move it to the outside of the pan.

&amp;#x200B;

(you may need to add a touch more oil at this stage depending on which type you use)

&amp;#x200B;

3 - Throw your diced onion, ginger, garlic and chilli into the pan and with a potato masher, mash them together.  Once they are cooked and kind of ""pulpy"" looking, ( maybe a minute or so) add the tomato paste continue mashing to form one paste. 

&amp;#x200B;

4 - Add your tomatoes and mash together with your paste. Allow those a minute or so heat right through and draw the flavour from the garlic etc.

&amp;#x200B;

5 - Then Add your Curry and Chilli powder and (Optional) chopped Coriander/Cilantro. Have a little taste and add salt and pepper to you liking.

&amp;#x200B;

6 - Then start to pour your sauce over the omelette (you can chop your omelette or leave them whole) allow them to cook together for a couple of minutes.

7 - Serve with a sprig of coriander/Cilantro on top..

Healthy and simple granola-muesli recipe I came up with,"My boyfriend is a granola and yogurt fiend, but it’s hard to find any that’s both affordable and lower in sugar, so I worked on a recipe for my own this summer. This recipe is perfect for shopping from bulk bins, which are often cheaper than the packaged options and allow for exact amounts to be purchased and used up. It’s definitely not sweet, and produces granola with small chunks, so don’t expect Honey Bunches of Oats.

Combine in a bowl:

* 3 cups rolled oats or other rolled grain (we like rye)
* 1 cup nuts and seeds
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup applesauce or other pureed fruit
* 2 tbsp melted coconut oil
* 1 tbsp spices (optional)

Press onto a half sheet pan lined with a Silpat or parchment. Bake at 300F for 45 minutes or until dried and crispy. The more often you stir it, the fewer large chunks you’ll get. (I usually stir once after about 25 minutes.)

Cool. Stir in:

* 1 cup dried fruit

Some variations we’ve liked:

* Banana bread: walnuts, mashed banana, 1 tbsp cinnamon, raisins or banana chips (my boyfriend adds chocolate chips to his)
* Cherry vanilla almond: oats, sliced almonds, applesauce, 1/2 tsp vanilla bean powder, chopped unsweetened dried cherries
* Pumpkin spice: pumpkin seeds + sunflower seeds + flax seeds, canned pumpkin purée, 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice, omit fruit

Keeps at least a week (probably two) in a jar at room temperature. A note for the less nutrition aware: this is about 450-500 calories per cup, so I usually have half a cup over Greek yogurt or a full cup with some almond milk for breakfast.",EatCheapAndHealthy

- 1 green bell pepper 


- 1 large white onion 


- garlic 


- 1tbsp tomato sauce


- 1 chicken bouillon cube


- 1/2 tbsp ground cumino (the amount of spices is up to you. this is just what I put)
- salt

*You can use as much bell pepper or onion you'd like. I use half an onion and bell pepper. This is great because you can alter it any way you'd like.


Put small bit of oil in pan. Toast vermicelli noodles until browned. Add 1 cup of water (or 1 and 1/2 if you like it more soupy). Add all your ingredients, stir, and let simmer for a couple minutes. I simmer until the onions are soft.

Looking For Some Easy Recipes,"I am a university student who lives in a university dorm. The food here is tasteless and watery, so I started skipping dinner here and order food once or twice a week. But that was not very cost effective, so I started cooking food on my own. But the problem is that neither am I a good cook who is good with recipes, or do I have many ingredients as an option for me. I would like some help with the first part.

I would like it if r/ ECAH can share some easy recipes that don't cost much and don't have a lot of ingredients to use. 
Here are a few things that I would like you to keep mind

• Doesn't rely on too many ingredients
• Easy to make
• I only have an induction pan, an induction sauce pan like thing that can only hold upto 800ML and a sandwich griller. (A water kettle to if that's useful)
• No meat please (cooking them myself is a chore and vegetarian food is more cost effective)

I have tried cooking some pasta and sandwiches before. I tried white sauce pasta but I put too much flour in it and that ruined the taste. I have also tried Mac&amp;Cheese which was comparatively better.
I also tried making some pancakes, but I used olive oil in it(because I was too lazy and didn't buy butter) and that too got ruined.",EatCheapAndHealthy
Feeding 4 people that eat like 10?,"TL;DR: my grocery bill is $600 a mont feeding 4 adults. 10 lbs of meat a week. No beans, potatoes, bell peppers, and onions. Is it possible to cut this down?

So there are 4 people in my household: me (F) and 3 guys. The guys all eat a crapload. My husband and I are the only ones with income currently and I handle the food. 

Right now we are spending about $150 a week on food and I’d like to bring it down if possible. $600 a month seems like a LOT, even for 4 people. 

Current state of things:

* we have Winco, which is basically Aldi
* rotate through chicken, pork, and ground beef. Basically whatever is on the cheapest sale and we use about  10 lbs of meat
* 60 count thing of eggs and they don’t go to waste
* sandwich stuff: cheap bread, PB, canned tuna. Lunch meat and cheese which gets expensive, considering we buy quality and a lot is used per sandwich
* cheap supplemental crap: boxed Mac n cheese, store brand sphagettios, frozen pizza
* the giant bags of cereal

Current pickiness being accommodated for:

* no potatoes
* no beans
* no bell peppers
* no onions 
* no chili

The hardest part is my husband is the one who hates potatoes and beans. He despises beans in any form. He will eat mashed potatoes with cheese mixed in (cottage pie is a favorite here) but not in any other form. I am also a diabetic and try to cut down/sub out carbs. 

What I’m hoping to accomplish:

* Would like to drop the grocery bill to $100/week. $80-$100 would be amazing. 
*  Cut down on the amount of meat. 1-2 vegetarian meals a week?

Easy Lowcountry Boil,"I recently visited a coastal southern town and fell in love with a dish called ""low country boil"", a local seafood favorite that is actually super easy to make. I buy frozen, cooked shrimp from my local Aldi or Lidl to save money instead or going for fresh, but either kind works! You will need ample aluminum foil for this recipe. 

Easy Lowcountry Boil:

- 2 lb./1 pckg shrimp (defrosted if frozen)

- 1 lb. potatoes, cleaned and cut into small pieces

- 1 pckg sausage, thinly sliced (Polish kielbasa is great, but andouille sausage adds a spicy kick)

- 2-3 ears of corn, cut into wedges 

- 2 tbsp. butter, melted

- 1 tbsp. olive oil

- 1 tbsp. Old Bay seasoning (or other spices)

- Salt and pepper

- Fresh lemon wedges, if desired 

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Toss all ingredients except for lemons in a large bowl. Have aluminum foil ready to cut into pieces for portions. Shape foil into ""boats"" to portion the mixture into. These ""boats"" will be sealed completely so the food can steam-cook.

Divide the mixture evenly among ""boats"", there should be enough for 4-6 servings. Add packets to large baking sheet and cook 15-20 minutes in the oven. Be careful when opening them after cooking, as hot steam will come out (I use tongs).

Sprinkle the yummy boil with lemon squeezes if desired and eat directly from the packets! Easy clean up as well.",EatCheapAndHealthy

Breakthrough (over takeout) because of a breakup!,"Earlier this year, I ended an ultimately shitty relationship.

The food budget was a point of contention for my ex and I. Roughly 20-25% of our weekly $100CAD budget for two was spent on snacks for him... His favorite snacking preferences did not overlap with mine, so they were indeed for him and him alone. Despite this, I continued to consult him as I designed weekly meal plans that we were both supposed to be happy eating but would later turn out to be inadequate. Being the one to keep track of all of our finances, the meal planner, the sole cook (and dishwasher most of the time regardless of everything else I was), I didn't feel comfortable buying anything ""extra"" for myself in the grocery store but I would \*constantly\* end up getting takeout multiple times later in the week because I was so exhausted.

A different obstacle was that he always discouraged me from going grocery shopping without him, but absolutely refused to go in the mornings before he had work so it usually ended up being after I had work, on his day off. I barely had time to drop my things off at home before heading out again, let alone cook first, and that'd result in hangry bickering in the grocery store.

Fast forward to now: I am splitting that same budget with a roommate-slowly-turned-boyfriend. We spend the extra money on chicken breasts for him and we spend the extra money on vegan alternatives for me (which he is also consistently and unbegrudgingly open to trying). He actually makes suggestions for the meal plan when I ask him what he wants to eat, and his suggestions are rooted in what we both like or want to try. He was unexpectedly unavailable to go grocery shopping with me today, and thanked me for running the errand without him. Without fail, he does the dishes and wipes the counters, and thanks me for cooking or prepping vegetables anyway.

TL;DR - If your partner isn't stepping up to the plate and you find it hard to bear the weight of balancing healthy eating and cheap eating, have an open discussion. If it doesn't take, honestly examine the other aspects of your relationship and give yourself the same advice you'd give someone in your shoes... I know now that it shouldn't have been as hard as it was. :)

Things that can be prepared a few hours before eating in a sandwich toaster?,"Hello!  


I'm looking to buy a sandwich toaster to prepare lunch during workdays. It would have to stay fresh (well, edible, I don't mind if it gets a big soggy) for at least 4-5 hours.  


My ideas were basically cheese/cheese and bacon/red pesto and mozzarella and... that's it.  


I'd love to do something with cream cheese, but the toasting process would probably make it all... weird, let alone storing it at room temperature for a few hours.  


So.... what else could I use? I don't like mixing sweet and savoury foods and I don't like goats cheese and blue cheese. Meat is ok, but veggie would be fine or even preferred.  
It doesn't have to be 100% healthy (cheese and bacon probably isn't), but I'd like it to be minimal effort as I'm not a morning person at all.   


Maybe I will go for a panini press if there are recipes I really like that aren't suitable for the sandwich toaster, I would, however, prefer a sandwich toaster.  


So...what would work well here? Could I make the cream cheese work somehow? (I think it would go well with most meats or even courgette.) Are there maybe alternatives I could use that would have a somewhat similar taste?

"Super easy and filling meal: sweet potato, kale, mushrooms.","I have made this for lunch or dinner, and I'm sure it'd make a great breakfast too. You could even throw an egg or two in there.

I microwave the sweet potato until it's done.
I sauté mushrooms (I usually use oyster or shiitake depending on what I can find; these shrooms are MUCH healthier for you than buttons or baby bellas. Source: I worked on a mushroom farm) along with kale or spinach in some olive oil.
Throw on some salt and pepper, pile the veggies on that potato, and add anything else you want that you have on hand, such as plain Greek yogurt or sour cream.
Sometimes I'll cook the veggies in teriyaki sauce if I have it; having some kind of sauce adds a nice ""casserole"" feel to the potato and veggies, if that makes sense.

I have my groceries delivered but I still didn't have enough time to plan out a meal plan for the week.  So I tried Sunbasket. Still a bit more than I'd like to pay per meal, for me I'm averaging between $11-$14 per meal, but in the last month we have only eaten out 4 times and we are spending less for much better quality and healthier food.

I plan one meal a week that usually makes leftovers and Sunbasket takes care of the other 4 meals. 

Where I live one person eating takeout usually comes out to the same price and then I usually had my ""good intentions groceries"" dying in the fridge. 

I am so glad I tried this, it has me feeling better and I don't dread dinner when I'm coming home.

TL;DR: A good way to break the takeout habit is a meal delivery service. While similar in price to takeout, you save money because you don't buy as many groceries that spoil in the fridge.",EatCheapAndHealthy

Roasted Apples 🍎,"Saw someone post here earlier about loving frozen fruit like grapes, and strawberries - so I thought I’d also share this easy, cheap recipe for roasted apples, that will satisfy your WARM sweets craving! I also use this as a side dish sometimes if I have something really hearty, and filling as my main course. 

All you need is 3 gala apples, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 3 tablespoons of sugar. 

Here is the exact recipe I use: https://cookinginstilettos.com/roasted-apples/ but essentially you just slice your apples, pop them in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, and add the extras halfway through! Healthier than eating apple pie, and tastes oh so good.",EatCheapAndHealthy

"I didn’t realize how easy, cheap, and versatile crepes are until I made them at home","Forgive my format, I’m on mobile. 

I pay an average of $17 per crepe at my local restaurant, not including drinks or tip. I have an eating out addiction and crepes are one of my biggest weaknesses. But yesterday I looked up a crepe recipe and was stunned to see I had all the ingredients already in my cupboard. 

1 cup flour. 
2 cups milk. 
2 eggs. 
2 tablespoons of sugar. 
1/4 teaspoon of salt. 
And 4 tablespoons of butter. 
Throw it all in a blender. Refrigerate for 20 minutes. Throw some butter on a pan and follow the technique shown in any video and BAM... you got delicious crepes. I didn’t even have to spend anything for that part and it made me 5 crepes, with a few mess ups in between. 
 
For this morning I spent:
 $1.98 for a carton of strawberries. 
.75 for three bananas. 
$2.98 for a carton of blueberries. 
And $1.98 for cool whip. 
That totals out to $7.69. I can eat strawberry banana crepes for three mornings with what I just bought/ made, and each crepe totals out to about $2.56. 

$2.56 per crepe. And I was paying $17 per crepe! I’ve been a fool paying outrageously for labor! And you could put literally anything in them! Fruits, veges, meat, cheese ect. The possibilities are endless is wayyy cheaper and easier then I ever expected.

Food keeps rotting in my fridge! Help!,"I live alone but I have a really busy life. I work a rotating shift with a different shift every week. I also play hockey 5-6 days a week. Often I am so tired after I go home I have no energy to cook, all I want to do is sleep. As a result food in my freezer goes unused. I do not buy fresh veggies or fruit because they would just go bad in my fridge. By my calculations about $300-500 of food goes to waste.

I have no problems buying cheap food or eating simply. I shop the cheapest discounted grocery stores and Asian food marts. I do not have very discerning taste buds. I have no problems eating just one simple dish a meal.

I buy frozen vegetables but I have a small condo-sized fridge with 3 half drawers for a freezer. One drawer holds probably no more than 6-7 packs of frozen veggies. I also have canned chicken on hand but I do not really cook my own meat.

Help me find foods things that (1) would freeze but not take up too much room in the freezer because I have next to none; (2) foods that can store for a long time in the fridge (i.e. a month or even two); (3) canned foods that do not taste bad; and (4) suggest a simple dishes I can make from them - meaning minimal steps. Keep in mind that I am trying to cut down my carbs because I'm borderline pre-diabetic and I already heat up my veggies with some butter.

Right now my go to dish is to have ramen with some frozen dumplings topped with a lot cilantro and green onions for garnish (frozen as well) and a side of veggies. I am not a creative person.",EatCheapAndHealthy
"In light of the intense summertime heat, let's talk the perfect, refreshing, super healthy summertime beverage.","Iced Green &amp; Herbal Tea (combined)

Take a big ole pot, and boil a good gallon or so of water, and steep a bunch of green tea along with a preferred herbal tea (my go-to are hibiscus or lemon-ginger). Green tea isn't a preferred flavor to many, so you can bolster it with your favorite herbal flavor, which almost completely masks the green tea flavor (depending on proportions). Alternatively, you can use white tea, which is even milder and may even be healthier than green, but is pricier. After steeping: let it cool off, pour it in a pitcher, and throw it in the fridge. Voila! The perfect summertime beverage.

Water is great and all, but tea hydrates as well and has tons of health properties such antioxidants and polyphenols - and yet it's zero calories. It is anti-cancer, slows cognitive decline and other aging associated health issues, and can help with weight-loss.

Fill up a bottle with it before you go out on a hot day and you'll never have to waste money on over-priced, sugary drinks again.

A large bottle of it is naught but pocket change and provides hydration and tons of other health benefits, so why wouldn't you?!

Update: You guys have saved us so much money!,"I posted 6ish weeks ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/bwsr3u/we_eat_breakfast_most_lunches_and_most_dinners_at/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) about how my husband and I were somehow spending $800 a month on groceries between the two of us and also going out to eat 7ish times a month. I’m not sure if I mentioned it there, but my husband was also eating out for lunch everyday and I was eating out 2-3x a week for lunch. I was blown away with the feedback I got (actually it was a little overwhelming—I was on vacation at the time and the notifications just wouldn’t stop. TBH I didn’t read all of them, but read most of them).

As soon as we got back from vacation I implemented some changes. I knew it wasn’t realistic to go full top ramen every meal every day; I wanted some balance. Here’s what I did:

-We started eating vegetarian meals 2-3 times per week. My husband and I both grew up eating meat at every meal and were surprised how full we could be without meat. We both love black bean burrito bowls, chickpea “gyro” pitas, and spaghetti with sauce from scratch (note: this is a tad bit more expensive than canned sauce or even basing it around canned tomatoes, but it works for us and the whole batch of spaghetti costs $5ish. I’m good with that.)

-When we do buy meat, I now always split the package up and freeze. Even the smallest pack of meat is more than enough for two of us, so we stretch our money a bit by getting two dishes out of it. 

-I make enough for leftovers for lunch. I now structure meals around what my husband can easily take to work and heat up the next day. If it doesn’t make leftovers, we eat it on Friday or Saturday. Unfortunately, the way my job works, leftovers isn’t doable for me, but I’ve started bringing lunches that don’t need to be refrigerated and I can graze when I get a chance. This is still much cheaper than going out to lunch each day. 

-We don’t go out to eat as much. I’m making an effort to use food before it expires (we had a lot of waste before) and now if we go out to eat, that usually means something is going to waste. That’s not to say we haven’t gone out at all, but it’s saved for times when I’ve had a shit day at work and just can’t make myself cook. We also have frozen homemade lasagnas in case that happens, but we’re learning balance here too. 

-I started intermittent fasting. This wasn’t a “save money” move, but who knew that skipping breakfast and late night snacking would also save money? 🤷🏻‍♀️

These were all minor tweaks, in my opinion. Our grocery bill has gone down (from $200 a week to around $100-120 a week) and we’re saving by not eating out as much. I figured these small changes would save us maybe $100-200 a month. You guys. We’re saving $400-500 a month doing this!

Thank you so much for your help! We’ve been saving every spare penny we have to buy a house this year, and an extra $400-500 a month is HUGE in meeting our goal!",EatCheapAndHealthy

Suggestions for people who hate cooking and grocery shopping?,"I cook because I have to, not because I want to, and it's a tedious chore every time. Same with grocery shopping. I realized that recently, I've been eating practically nothing but scrambled eggs, peanut butter sandwiches, bananas, and a couple of different types of oranges.

As for grocery shopping, I always try to buy fruits to get some amount of healthy food in the house, but they keep getting rotten and moldy and I am seriously tired of wasting money on that. And I still don't know what exactly is a good deal. Every week, I have to use a grocery list that I strictly follow, because I hate having to choose what to buy, and I generally end up buying milk, bread, eggs, a few fruits (mostly bananas), certain things that have run out such as rice and dried lentils as needed, and not much else. The only positive I can say about it is that I never buy pure junk food like chips, ice cream, soft drinks (except for New Year's), and cookies, and I don't drink, so I don't buy alcohol, but that does not mean I am eating healthy.

Meat is out of the question, since it is much more expensive than fruits and vegetables everywhere I've seen it, and I've been trying to be a bit more environmentally conscious anyway. The cheapest meat I've seen is ground pork at Costco, and even that is too expensive.

Basically, what are your suggestions to minimize the amount of time and money spent both cooking and grocery shopping while not eating like crap?

How to meal-prep dried large amount of dried beans to save money over purchasing canned beans.,"I eat a lot of canned beans, exactly one can per meal. This comes out to over $500 per year. [According](https://dontwastethecrumbs.com/cooked-beans-dry-beans-which-is-cheaper/) to some articles on the internet I can save over $200 per year by switching to dry beans, not including the cost of a stove. A can of beans cost about 0.63 cents for 1.75 cups of cooked beans. A pound of dried beans costs about $1.39 and makes about 7 cups of cooked beans, equivalent to 4 cans, so purching dried beans cost the equivalent of 0.35 per can, saving 0.28 per can. For me, at two cans per day, this results in yearly savings of $204.4. Even if you only eat 4 cans per week, this will still save you $58 per year.

What I want to do is cook a large quantity of beans in one occasion, that can last me one or two weeks. One can of beans contains 1.75 cups; twice a day for 7 days is is 24.5 cups of cooked beans, and for 14 days is 49 cups of cooked beans. 1 pound of dried beans makes about 7 cups of cooked beans, so for 1 week/24.5 cups I need 3.5 pounds of dried beans, and for 2 weeks/49 cups I need 7 pounds of dried beans.

I have a sous vide device that I figured I would use [Some](https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-no-soak-beans) recommendations are 6 hours at 190F. I don't know if it's true but most sous vide users claim that the operating costs are immaterial. If you don't have one you could always do the 8 hour cold immersion method if you didn't want to lose money by cooking on the stove. If anyone here can help with the math of cooking on stove that would be great.

I have some questions:

How am I going to safely store this amount of beans in my refridgerator? Can I simply use a large plastic tupper ware and then each meal take out 1.75 cups? Will the beans even last for 1-2 weeks? How do I know when/if it goes bad?

With canned beans I can dump the contents into a pan, and the can always includes a fair amount of liquid that helps with heating up the beans. I assume that when cooking the beans myself, this liquid will not be there or it will be trapped in the bottom of the container. Can I simply substitute some water in the pan or is there a better way?",EatCheapAndHealthy

My results experimenting with seitan,"I'm trying to incorporate more cheap protein sources into my diet. Here's my procedure and results:

Procedure: Mix whole wheat flour with enough water to create a stiff dough ball, knead under running water until the rinse comes off clear and the result is spongy and elastic

Products: 54g wet seitan, 42g with as much water squeezed out by hand as possible.

If I wanted to be sciency I would've dried it and calculated the yield but I wanted a burger instead. Hypothetically, the resulting burger patty would have had 12g protein, 1.5g fat,9g fiber and some indeterminate amount of insoluble ash content and water which don't affect the macros. For a total of 97.5 kcal. Considering a 5lb(2270g) bag is $5.00 at my local store, that would mean each burger costs around 20 cents and one bag makes 25 of them.

"For Meat Eaters: To save money, think of meat as a side dish to your meal, not the main entree","This may seem elementary to most people, but when we figured this out it really was a game changer for us in how we grocery shop and cook.  We used to think of the meat as the main part of our dinner and we'd add veggies and fillers as the side dishes.

The added bonus is that doing things this way has also opened our palates to a wider variety of vegetables than we had consumed before.

My new FAVORITE breakfast. Egg white oatmeal with bluebs and nut butter! Everything from Costco!,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/bbw7g9zv3q931.jpg

If you're weirded out by the thought of egg whites in your oatmeal, don't be! You can't taste them, and it just makes the oatmeal unbelievably creamy.

**Here's everything I got at Costco**:

10 lbs box of Quaker Oats ($10)

5 lbs bag of frozen Organic Blueberries ($10)

16 oz, 6 ct Liquid Egg Whites ($10)

Organic Creamy Peanut Butter, 28 oz, 2 ct ($11) OR Creamy Almond Butter, 27 oz ($9.59)

&amp;#x200B;

**Specific measurements and ingredients I use:**

1/2 cup of oats 

1 cup of water

3-4 tbsp egg whites 

*1 tsp vanilla extract \*optional\**

*1/2 tsp cinnamon \*optional\**

1/4 cup of frozen blueberries 

1 tbsp either peanut butter or almond butter 

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions**:

Add oats, and (if using) cinnamon and vanilla extract to a pot. Add water and stir to combine. Heat over medium-high heat for 6-7 minutes or until all the liquid has been absorbed. 

Take the pot off the heat and add egg whites into the oats and stir constantly. Stirring will keep the egg whites from scrambling.

Place the pot back on the stove top and stir for about 2 minutes or until the mixture is creamy and fluffy. 

Pour the oatmeal into a bowl and spoon nut butter over it while the oats are still hot! 

Place the blueberries into a microwave safe bowl and microwave until they're warm, and almost resemble chunky blueberry jam! Spoon over oatmeal and enjoy :)

Edit: 
Missed the step about returning the pot to the stove to continue cooking the egg whites!",EatCheapAndHealthy
Bean Burgers!,"I've recently started making bean burgers and they're crazy cheap, tasty, and healthy. Here's the basic recipe I use. 

1 can of black beans 

1/4 cup bread crumbs

1/2 onion

1 egg

1 clove garlic

1/2 tablespoon of oregano

Salt and pepper to taste

Mash beans until mostly crushed but still sightly chunky. Then combine and form into patties. There's no need to grease the pan. 

Bake at 375°f for 20 minutes, flipping half way through. 

Yields 4 patties

I also recommend topping with Sriracha mayo. You can also make this with other types of beans but I find black beans to work the best.

Edit: another thing we do sometimes is grate some carrot or zucchini to add to the mix",EatCheapAndHealthy

Lazy college Southwest chicken bowls -$2 per meal,"This is my go to favorite meal prep when I’m feeling super lazy. It’s delicious and cheap! 

Recipe:
1. Knorr Spanish rice packet - .99 (I also sometimes get Mexican rice from rice a roni, whatever is on sale)
1 rotisserie chicken -5$
1 can of diced tomatoes and green chilies -.99
1 tbsp of butter (optional)
1 bag birds eye steam fresh corn - 1$
Chili powder + cumin to taste 

I follow the directions on the rice packet and while that is cooking I shred the rotisserie chicken. 

Once the rice is done I add the chicken, spices and tomatoes+green chilies to a pan and let it simmer on low/medium stirring occasionally and pop the corn into the microwave. Once corn is done I turn off the chicken stir it one last time and divide into 4 meal prep containers. 

Sometimes If I’m feeling fancy I’ll add a dollop of guacamole from the store (5$) which brings the cost per meal up to 3.25.

Update on Slow Cooker/InstaPot,"This is crazy. I work at a church in Congregational Care (like when someone dies or is in the hospital or just needs a shoulder). We’re a friendly bunch who genuinely like each other - which is why I found myself asking about their own experiences. And THEN our secretary told me she had given one to her mom and they were still busy cleaning out the house and they found a brand new Crock Pot brand that sautés, slow cooks, and express cooks and cooks rice. Her mom had never taken it out of the box! It was still taped shut!

Our secretary lives close by, so she ran home and got it. People, it was in the box and had never been used! So they just gave it to me with big hugs. The sec’s mom and I had had a great relationship / I spoke at her funeral, etc, I tried to offer payment or make a donation somewhere, but they weren’t having that. Sec said “You know Mom adored you, and I can’t think of anyone she would be more excited to have it” 

So I got a brand new crockpot - WITH a removable piece for easier cleaning (see, I was listening!) - and I will remember my hilarious friend Betty when I use it. I’ve named the Crock Pot Betty. 

So now I’m really fired up to use it! I can’t start till the weekend, but have tons of your recipes and can find more. I’m SO appreciative of the whole family. 

And I’m appreciative of all of your tips and thoughts so I was ready to know what I needed/wanted. I’m shocked that I’m so excited about it, but there you go!

Had no idea this sub existed. Here's a nutrient density/cost efficiency cheat sheet I've been working on for a few months.,"Sheet Link: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VnG4oMoHyjMZLvSVgoKYzNFnZUKXlAuvipIghhUk-QQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VnG4oMoHyjMZLvSVgoKYzNFnZUKXlAuvipIghhUk-QQ/edit?usp=sharing)

So, the prices will be most relevant where I live (Manitoba). But I imagine many prices will be conserved across North America. Hopefully someone finds this useful.

I used a bunch of different data-points to calculate various scores/values based on some criteria I care about. Firstly, the nutrient density score is an arbitrary calculation of nutrient density using a point system per 100g of food. If a food delivered over a certain percentage of the DRI of a given nutrient, it would be assigned a point per nutrient. If a food delivered over 5% of the DRI for a given nutrient, 1 point was assigned. Over 10%, 2 points. Over 20%, 3 points. Over 40%, 4 points. Over 80%, 5 points. If the food provided over 100% of the DRI of a nutrient, it got six points for that nutrient. Based on this system, beef liver gets a final score of 79. Apples get a final score of 1. Something like bok choy gets a score of 26. You get the idea.

The first score is the vitamin E to polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) ratio. Because they're the only two nutrients I'm convinced actually need to be rigidly maintained in a particular ratio. That is to say, out of all of the nutrients said to be maintained at a particular ratio, vitamin E and PUFA are the only two that actually make good sense, haha.

The second score is straight up nutrition per calorie. But it favours foods that are very high in water, like orange juice or coffee. So, I rarely organize the list by this column. It's just there for fun.

The third is the caloric weight score. I took the caloric weight (100g minus water and fibre), divided by calories, then divided by the nutrient density score. This *slightly* artificially favours high-fat foods, but nevertheless it is a good stratification of nutrient density that isn't terribly confounded by water or fibre.

The fourth column is the cost efficiency score. It's the nutrition by caloric weight divided by price--how much nutrition per dollar spent.

The fifth column is the PUFA value. The equation takes the nutrition by caloric weight divided by PUFA divided by price. Basically this gives you foods that offer the least amount of PUFA and the most amount of nutrition per dollar. And no, this **DOES NOT** overly favour high saturated fat foods. If anything it favours really, really low fat foods like protein isolates, concentrates like Marmite, vegetables, and fruit.

The fibre value just gives you best bang-for-buck, most nutrient dense options adjusted by fibre content. So, how to get the most amount of nutrition for the least money while also providing the most fibre.

I've found it very useful to organize the spreadsheet by cost efficiency and just buy the first 20 items on the list instead of making grocery lists from scratch, haha. I've managed to reduce my personal biweekly shopping trips from $150 to $75 whilst also improving the nutrient density of my diet overall. Right now, my diet consists of: organ meats, bananas, plantains, mixed vegetables, nutritional yeast, whey protein, lentils, milk, eggs, and muesli.

According to Cronometer, the foods I typically each allow me to achieve complete nutrition at around 1000 kcal. Whereas before it would take me closer to 2000 kcal to meet adequate nutrition. So, I'm more or less exceeding the DRI of every nutrient by 100% on a daily basis eating 2000 kcal. This spreadsheet has been a remarkable tool for me. Hopefully it helps someone else save money.

UPDATE! I've included protein, carbs, fats, minerals, and phytate. I'm still working on it, but there is now a mineral to phytate ratio score and a protein value score. The mineral to phytate ratio is the total mineral content divided by the phytate content, but with a special condition to avoid DIV0 errors. When the phytate is zero, the score will favour the relative proportion of minerals in a food. For the protein value, it's protein divided by the caloric weight, divided by calories, divided by cost, divided by the sum of carbs and fats. So, it's basically the maximum nutrient density and protein calories for the least total calories per dollar.

"Should we change the title of the sub, to just, Eat Cheap?","This is some food for thought, no pun intended. I’ve been lurking here for a long time, and very rarely seem to find recipes that are “healthy” when looked at from a certain perspective. SODIUM. 

I have a long history of kidney stones, had my first one when I was 12, I’ve had over 30 now at 26, and have had two surgically removed, and a whole set blasted with sound waves. Sodium is a huge factor in the production in kidney stones, not the only one. But one that is paramount in controlling. So I need a low sodium diet. Plus all of you do to, for your kidneys, your heart, and the overall health of your body in general. Sodium is not good for us.

Mushroom and spinach sandwich,"I've been making this for myself a lot over the past few years. I am a big meatlover but I still make an effort to eat less. This is definitely my go-to for satisfying my cravings for beef, it's just so savory and filling. It's something I discovered a few years ago as I was experimenting with cooking mushrooms (I always thought I hated them but it turns out they're delicious if cooked right.) I'm not really a recipe person, so sorry if I can't spell it out for you professionally.

I like to use sourdough bread but I have also used really good fresh French baguettes. Definitely toast the bread. I pan fry the mushrooms in either olive oil or butter and will usually add balsamic vinaigrette, garlic or any herbs I may have. And of course a lot of salt. I usually cook them slow on medium heat. I have also tried roasting portobellos which is another delicious option. 

When the mushrooms are done, I add the spinach and it usually cooks super fast since the mushrooms are hot. I then eat it with a little dijon mustard which I think makes the whole thing. It's usually pretty juicy and a little messy, but good bread will hold it all together. I'm from California and I eat avocado with everything, so that's always a possibility.

* Every morning I eat a bowl of about 150g of Liberte Greek Yogurt (plain) with some chia seeds and either blueberries/raspberries/blackberries. Is this ok to eat every day, even though it's nothing solid? Does this sound like a pretty healthy/cheap breakfast in your opinion?
* I eat chia seeds to be healthy, but I don't particularly like the texture, if I can handle swigging down a shot of chia seeds with some yogurt to get them all ""down the hatch"" at once, is this just as effective in terms of their fibre benefits etc?

Looking for a list of South Asian substitutes to Western ingredients in foods commonly suggested on this thread. Any suggestions?,"I am trying to make breakfast recipes from ideas that I got from this sub. Examples would be an egg hash, a potato salad, chili con carne,  among others.

Meal(plan)s for sleeping problems suggestions?,"Hi guys,

Let me introduce myself, I am 27/F, have a desk job with fulltime computer screen, I do sports too little but I think I live quite healthy. However, I sleep very poorly at night and my work-physician (?) told me I could take a look at my eating pattern and see whether I can improve something. Google has kinda an overload on information, and at the same time not enough, so I thought I might take a chance on asking it here. I think most improvement can be done on my dinner habits, but not sure what. 


My sleeping problems are both falling asleep, as sleeping through the night (I wake up like 4 times a night and have like 3 dreams that I can remember in detail per night).


Here are my (eating) habits: sorry if the formatting is screwed up, I'll try to fix it but on mobile and not familiar with formatting here.. 

-First of all, I am a vegetarian and trying to eat vegan if I can, but only if it's easy, cheap and available. 

-I usually drink 1 - 2 coffee a day, usually my first one with powdered milk, no sugar, and the second black. Both before 1PM. After that I drink green tea at work until 5, and at home I drink water or herbal tea. 

-I drink alcohol once a week in the weekends. (used to drink almost every day but I stopped doing that about 5 months ago).

-I try to drink 4 bottles of water every day at work.

-Usually my breakfast is an apple and a banana, or if I'm hungry: overnight oats with almond milk, berries and seeds. But I have never been a breakfast eater and the thought of eating something within 3 hours of waking up makes me nauseated. 

-Lunch is usually one of three things: 1. Leftover from dinner. 2. 2 slices of Rye bread or spelt bread with vegetarian paté and some veggies like half a cucumber and a bell pepper. 3. Most often I get lunch at work and it's a salad from the salad bar, consisting out of for example: 3tbsp of tuna, 2 tbsp beans/lentils etc, 2 tbsp of cooked veggies like broccoli, 2 tbsp of some raw salad veggies like cucumber, 1 tbsp of feta cheese and 3 tbsp of couscous/pasta/potato etc. 

-Dinner varies a lot. Very often I have training in the evening and have to eat at work. Then it's either a poke bowl, pizza, pasta or burrito rice bowl because that's all there is in the neighborhood. I cannot take food with me for dinner from home. If I eat outside of work, I often eat with friends and cannot really decide what we eat, and usually it's at a restaurant. From now on I have the chance to eat at home more often because my training period is done, but my eating pattern has been screwed up so much because of work, that I have the chance to build up completely new habits, so most help is needed here I guess. So what foods should I avoid 'before bed' and what should I eat more of? 


Other difficulties I have are eating enough iron, magnesium and protein while vegetarian.",EatCheapAndHealthy

HOBO DINNER RECIPE,"So I remember being a kid and my dad made these for us when my mom was busy working or not home that night. Basically it's just hamburger, potatoes, onion, and carrots. 

Makes 4 servings. 

Ingredients:

- 1 lb hamburger

- 2 potatoes 

- 1 onion

- roughly 2 cups carrots (baby carrots work good too)

- salt, pepper, and/or seasoning of choice

- aluminium foil

- nonstick cooking spray


Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°.

Dice potates, onions, and carrots (or use baby carrots).
Season hamburger with salt and pepper or any preferred seasoning of choice.
Divide hamburger into 4 quarter pound patties. 
Divide the diced vegetables into 4 servings. 

Take aluminum foil and make 4 sheets (about 13 inches long) and spray with nonstick cooking spray. 
Place each hamburger patty in the middle of each section of foil. Add the potatoes, onion, and carrots on top and around the patties.
Add salt and pepper to taste. 
Fold and seal the foil tight. Place on cookie sheet and bake for 1 hour. 

*Note: The amount of vegetables you use can be adjusted.  Some use 1 potatoe per foil packet where I used about a half potatoe per packet. Also I used baby carrots and just took a handful for each serving. Some recipes also add gravy.",EatCheapAndHealthy

Scared about bacteria on leafy greens and how to disinfect. What works and what doesn't?,"I posted here because I'm looking for cheap ways to eat healthier, and I figured this was related. I bought a bunch of those clear plastic containers of leafy greens, specifically kale and baby spinach. I'm new to eating really any veggies so I'm already really sensitive to the texture and between that and the e coli. stuff with lettuce it makes it really difficult to know if I'm doing the right thing or not. 

I basically just take the kale/spinach out, get a strainer and put half of it in (roughly the serving I want a day). If I see any spotty/melty leaves I remove them and any kale with big stems I destem them because I heard you can't eat kale stems (even though the bag says it's triple washed and ready to eat). Then I rinse it out and move the leaves around. Then I essentially put them in a pan with oil, and cook them until they're tiny and wilted and cooked looking. I also throw some balsamic vinegar on it, and some chicken and toasted sesame. 

So essentially my routine is take some out, take out any gross looking leaves, wash in water, cook in a pan, drizzle in balsamic vinegar. Is this ok? Am I overdoing it or under doing it? Can I just rinse these in water and then microwave them for a bit to destroy the bacteria, or does the pan do that for me if I leave them on till they're tiny? Sorry if these seem like dumb questions I really don't know anything about veggies and I'm kind of paranoid about getting sick from them, so much so that I barely wanna eat them and I wanna just toss them out.",EatCheapAndHealthy

"Family of 9 (2 adults/7children) looking for ways to eat better, cheaply","My wife is amazing at making meals- but isn’t the best at saving leftovers. So there’s money wasted right there. On average we spend about $1000-1500/month on groceries. I want/need to spend less, as I have all my other bills yet to pay for on an income of $3-4K/month. 

We plan meals, but I think we can do better. We are “old school” I guess some would say as she takes care of all household duties, (cooking cleaning etc) and I work 7 days a week, 2 jobs to support us. 

With nearly half my income going to food, and half my income going to living expenses, I am looking for pointers to help cut costs and keep the kids and her full 3x’s a day. 

We have Aldi, Giant, Weis, Wegmans, BJs/Costco and Walmart as well as a handful of discount grocers. Due to time constraints I usually hit up Giant as it’s on my way of travel from work. 

Kids have picky palates, and I’ve enforced the “eat what’s in front of you” rule as I work hard to buy it, and she works hard to cook it. 

We eat many meals from scratch, (chicken Alfredo, Mac and cheese, turkey manicotti in Alfredo sauce: all with homemade sauces) meatloafs, lots of chicken- and I’m starting to really hate chicken. 

I love vegetables, but we only ever have carrots, broccoli, potatoes, spinach (wife) lettuce, green beans, peas. Those are the staples in my house. Nothing new rarely ever pops up.

Please adhere to this in your recipes. This is a place to share and discuss recipes, and not a place to argue about lifestyles.

What is Meatless Monday? Meatless Monday is not a new idea. During World War I, the U.S. Food Administration urged families to reduce consumption of key staples to aid the war effort. “Food Will Win the War,” the government proclaimed, and “Meatless Monday” and “Wheatless Wednesday” were introduced to encourage Americans to do their part.

What is the point today? Because going meatless once a week may reduce your risk of chronic preventable conditions like cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. And going meatless once a week can also help reduce our carbon footprint and save precious resources like fossil fuels and fresh water.

Need help making a meal plan for a variable amount of physical activity.,"So, I’m in a bit of a weird position with my job and physical activity I do each day. I’m a Pipefitter/welder, working 6 days a week, 10 hours a day. Thing is, my job is different every day. Some days I’m burning thousands of calories from lifting and climbing and using tools. Other days, like today, I end up sitting and welding for majority of the day, so I burn little amount of calories, just whatever i burn through sweat. 

I’ve been running into problems though with my current lunch where I’m super low on energy and always at least slightly hungry. I drink plenty of water, so I know it’s not thirst masking as hunger. 

Problem is I have next to no free time. My total commute per day is at least 3.5 hours. With everything said and done I’m gone from home for 16 hours a day. This leaves just enough time to eat dinner, take a shower, and go to bed to try and get 6 hours of sleep. It leaves me little time to research and plan out some meals that I can prep on Sundays, which is why I’ve come here for some quick help on simple meals I can make that’ll keep me energized for work. Any help would be appreciated! Hopefully I’ll be able to fine tune it and get a solid plan down in a couple weeks!",EatCheapAndHealthy

How to get started ECAH,"Hello ECAH!

I’d like to make a post specifically for newcomers who have no idea where to start. I am not a very extreme budgeter and spend about $50-$60 a week for two people. My husband and I are both in college and work part time so we have very busy schedules, so I know how easy it can be to just grab fast food on your way home, and how daunting cooking your own meals can be.

If you’re looking to dip your toe into ECAH, here’s how we get by:

**Meal Planning**

Every weekend my husband and I pick out 6 dinners we can make the coming week (we allow ourselves one “cheat” day to eat out.) I have a master spreadsheet of recipe ideas that include things from Pinterest, various cookbooks, and meals that don’t need recipes (such as spaghetti with meat sauce). This really helps my husband and I because we can just pick items from the list instead of trying to brainstorm what we could possibly make.

Try to pick meals that have common ingredients. For example, I don’t typically have sour cream on hand because I don’t use it that often. If I need to get sour cream for a recipe, I’ll try to find at least one other recipe that requires sour cream so it doesn’t go to waste.

In that same vein, try to pick meals that have ingredients on sale. I typically pull up my grocery store’s weekly ad while picking meals to see what’s on sale — ESPECIALLY meat. For example, I like to make chicken pot pies around the holidays because the ingredients are usually on sale.

Try to fit a veggie into every dinner. You’ll find lots of cheap, flavorful vegetables if you pay attention to what’s in season. For example, in fall, spaghetti squash is less than 99¢ a pound and that’s almost a whole meal. Freezer vegetables are also cheap and go a long way. 

Even if you have a small household, don’t be scared of recipes with many servings. I like to prep a bunch of baked ziti then freeze it in separate little aluminum trays to bake a later day. Your freezer is your friend!!

**Grocery Shopping**

Once you’ve got your meals picked out, make a grocery list. Double check your pantry and fridge to see what ingredients you have on hand. Write down *just* what you need. This will prevent you from giving in to temptation at the grocery store. 

An old piece of advice is don’t go to the grocery store hungry! I have definitely bought more than I should have before just because I was hungry and xyz food “sounded good.” 

If you have more than one grocery store within a reasonable distance, don’t be afraid to shop around. I go to Winn Dixie, Publix, even Target and Walmart to get groceries just depending on what’s on sale that week.

If you really want to save money at the grocery store, you cannot be too picky about what brands you buy. My philosophy is simple:

1. If we need the item, we get the brand that’s on sale. 
2. If it’s not on sale and we need it, we get the store brand.
3. If it’s not on sale and we don’t need it, we don’t buy it.

Again, making lists really helps because you tend to stick to it. If you walk down every aisle just to browse, things you don’t need will find their way into your cart.

Also, as a side note, buy things that are on sale if you know you WILL need them, even if you don’t need them right now. Odds are, the toilet paper you like isn’t going to be on sale when you run out. Buy in advance and forget about it.

On that note, buying in bulk is usually cheaper. I like to buy big packs of meat and break it up into freezer bags. However, **do not buy more than you will actually use.** I am guilty of this sometimes — I will buy the bigger pack because it’s a better value or price per ounce, whatever, but we end up throwing half of it away anyway.

TL;DR — Plan your meals prior to grocery shopping. Find meals with common ingredients. Make a list and stick to it. Buy items that are on sale if you can help it.",EatCheapAndHealthy

Baked Lemon Chicken Pasta meal,"[Based off of this recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/patrick-and-gina-neely/easy-lemon-pasta-with-chicken-recipe-1911176)

- 1 lb of chicken breast ($5)
- Box of Penne Pasta ($1)
- Can of chicken broth (optional $1ish)
- Salt &amp; pepper will do fine, red pepper, garlic salt, and sea salt are better if you have them on hand. Premixed Lemon Pepper is great too. ( Get what you need/want. I bought lemon pepper for $3.50)
- Use whatever oil you have, i use vegetable oil, olive oil will taste better though.
- 1 Lemon ($1)
- Italian Cheese mix ($3-$4)
- Milk (optional, any type will do)
- Can of green beans ($2)

Chop the chicken breast into chunks or smaller finger and fry them in the skillet with whatever oil you have on hand. While this is going on, i boil the pasta in the chicken broth. I season the chicken with either sea salt, black corn pepper, and red pepper flakes, or just lemon pepper and red pepper flakes. 

Once the pasta and chicken are done, i move them into a baking dish. Strain the pasta (maybe save a little of the chicken broth water) and mix the two up well. Then add in the cheese well into the pasta chicken mix, Sprinkle some across the top as well. Squirt half of a lemon cut let around the dish. Sometimes i'll throw in a little bit of milk just cause.

Boil some green beans in salt, pepper, and butter. 

All together that should be between $13-20 depending on what you already have on hand or if you care to use chicken broth and different seasonings for the chicken. The recipe i based this off of probably costs less than the way i do it.",EatCheapAndHealthy
The Best Money Saving Tip Yet,"A family member gave me the easiest and most effective money saving tip I’ve ever tried. I was spending $30-$40 a week on groceries for two people. Now, I’m down to $15-$25 a week. First, even if you don’t meal prep, start making a meal plan. This will help you keep buying groceries that you’ll actually use during the week. 

Now this is where the real savings happen: when you start meal planning, don’t start by pawing through recipes or Pinterest posts. Start by looking at the ingredients you already have in your cupboard. Chances are, a lot of recipes you can make rely mostly on pantry staples. You also probably have a lot of odds and ends sitting in your cupboards that are just waiting to be used up. 

I slashed my grocery bill, but it doesn’t feel like there’s less food in the house. I just feel like I’m more aware of what I have and what I need to use up. I’m buying less extraneous ingredients and creating less food waste overall!

Edit: a lot of you are asking about what my grocery list looks like. I’m pretty frugal and both my partner and I have a limited income so we need to be careful. This definitely isn’t the only thing I do to save money. I shop pretty exclusively at Aldi m. They have a limited selection, but their prices are amazing. I’ve definitely adjusted my meal plans based on what I can get there. If you are lucky enough to live in the upper Midwest, Woodman’s also has amazing deals on pantry staples. 

My pantry is pretty well stocked with inexpensive canned and dried goods. When I buy produce I shop sales. I eat a lot of frozen vegetables, but I also try and catch those on sale. I also try to buy heartier vegetables (cabbage, cauliflower, carrots) that last longer. This new trick has helped me work better with what I already have in my pantry. Before I would stock up when things would go on sale and then not touch it. 

In general I eat a lot of beans, eggs, pasta, and lentils. I don’t buy meat and replace my proteins with more affordable options. It’s definitely a budget diet, and we do splurge on more expensive ingredients very occasionally, but we make it work! Overall, I’m pretty content with it.",EatCheapAndHealthy
Shopping on a Budget in Chicago,"First time posting,  I hope I'm doing this right😊

So here's how I cook healthy on a budget. I'm always open to advice and suggestions though. My maximum budget for food is $500.00 a month and with that I cook for myself, 2 kids(7 and 2 years old) 2 adult brothers and my mom. If mom wants something specific(lamb chops or kefta kabobs) that I don't cook she goes and gets that but obviously still uses the pantry/freezer as needed.

I think we're lucky in Chicago to have lots of stores so there's food deals to be had every week. I try to never pay more than the prices listed below and if I see a great deal that's cheaper than the prices below I try to stock up. I don't have time to meal plan but with frozen protein and a well stocked pantry there's always a meal to be had.
I did buy a standup freezer for $200.00 two years ago and it's paid for itself with what I save on meat and frozen vegetables. I highly suggest you keep your eyes peeled for one of these at scratch and dent type stores. 

I get organic produce maybe 25% of the time if I can find it. I don't waste gas by going to many stores. Usually I go to Dollar Tree monthly and either Aldi or local grocery stores once a week. I never shop at Walmart. My best tip is try to go grocery shopping an hour before stores close or an hour after they open. You'll find lots of markdown items since they need to make space for fresher products. That's how my freezer gets filled with whole turkeys,steak, ground beef, fish, and lamb for less than half price. 

These are what I consider my buy price. If what I want isn't within these prices it usually gets skipped. If I find it on my low end or cheaper I stock up. Some weeks I'll spend more because of stocking up but I find by the end of the month or the month after I've saved money by having it on hand.

"We eat the same thing for dinner almost every night, wife is getting bored of it.","So, I do all the cooking and have a rather busy schedule otherwise. Our cheap protein dinner option has been chicken breast from aldi. We bake couple of 9x11s at a time, which I then dice and divide to freeze. This makes meal prep during the week much easier with my schedule. Our regular dinner is usually this chicken, some brown rice, and a vegetable. She is getting bored with this.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, she doesn't like red meat, can't eat beans (because of a low fodmap diet thing), and I'm only in the mood for pork rarely. By process of elimination, that leaves chicken as a staple protein, which I'm kinda bored with as well, but I've come to terms with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really not sure what else do to with these limitations. We're trying to keep away from simple carbs, so brown rice (or quinoa) is a safe and cheap starch for us. Because of the fodmap thing, we're also pretty limited in vegatables. We tend to lean on kale, green beans, and sometimes some kind of squash.

&amp;#x200B;

She is quite a picky eater in general, on top of the fodmap thing, but she is definitively sick of this chicken. Is there some other option I have yet to consider that's inexpensive and not time consuming to prep? Thanks.",EatCheapAndHealthy
Fruit Freezing Tips Anyone?,"Any tips for freezing fruits?

I’ve frozen sliced strawberries and sliced peaches in ziplocs and they all end up in a thick gelatinous mass at the bottom that I physically have to chip away at. How do I do this better? When I bought commercially prepared frozen fruit, the fruits all seem to be in individual chunks  and easier to separate and pull out.

### Grade

Serves: 6

Cost: $

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 1 hour (30 minutes inactive)

### Ingredients for Stewed Chickpeas and Ground Meat

1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil

1 pound ground meat (boar, bison, beef, or turkey)

2 tablespoons butter

1 yellow onion, peeled and diced

8 ounces baby Bella mushrooms, trimmed and sliced

2 teaspoons mustard seeds (yellow, black, or both), optional

4 carrots, peeled and small-diced

2 tablespoons flour

3 cups chicken stock

1 14.5-ounce can tomato sauce

1 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes

1 28-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed

2 teaspoons sugar

Salt and pepper to taste

**Spice Mixture**

2 tablespoons curry powder

1 tablespoon chili powder

2 teaspoons cumin

2 teaspoons garlic powder

1 teaspoon cayenne powder, more or less to taste

½ teaspoon ground coriander, optional

**For Serving**

½ cup fresh parsley leaves, minced

2 teaspoons lemon juice, plus lemon wedges

Cooked rice

### Method

###### Prepare the Spice Mixture:

Combine the spices in a bowl and set aside.

###### Cook the Meat:

In a wide sauté pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the ground meat and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until well-browned all over and completely cooked through. Season with half the spice mixture and salt and pepper and toss to coat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked meat to a large bowl.

###### Sauté the Vegetables:

Add the butter to the pan over medium heat. Once melted and frothy, add the diced onion and cook for 4-5 minutes until softened.

Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring regularly, for 8-10 minutes until they release and re-absorb their liquid. They should be well-browned. Do not season with salt and pepper until after they’ve browned.

Add the carrots and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.

###### Prepare the Stew Base:

Return the cooked meat to the pan and toss to combine with the vegetables. Sprinkle the flour over all the ingredients in the pan and toss to combine. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the flour begins to turn golden brown.

Whisk in the chicken stock, scraping up browned bits at the bottom of the pan as you incorporate the stock. Bring to a boil.

###### Finish the Stew:

Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, chickpeas, sugar, and the remaining spice mix. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep the stew from sticking.

###### Prepare the Garnish:

In a bowl, combine the minced parsley with the lemon juice and a sprinkle of salt.

###### To Serve:

Spoon the stew over cooked rice and garnish with lemon wedges and the fresh parsley. Enjoy!",EatCheapAndHealthy

Its... okay. I wanted to make this so it would be less sodium than the little broth packets, but it's probably just as unhealthy tbh and not very cohesive flavor-wise. Curious if anyone here has come up with anything good.",EatCheapAndHealthy

First try at Shakshuka,"First let me say thank you to this sub. I had never heard of Shakshuka until I saw it in the comments of a “Chinese tomato and egg stir fry” post a little while back. I watched the video below, followed the recipe and it’s great. 

[In all its glory](https://imgur.com/gallery/mWQQAjR) I followed [this recipe](https://youtu.be/Iy3mUtlvw84)

Now a question: I admit to being an American with dulled tastebuds that likes a lot of flavor. This dish was mainly dominated by the tomatoes. I like tomatoes so that’s ok, but I didn’t taste the smoked paprika or the harissa really. My favorite thing in this dish was the Kalamata olives. 

Overall, the flavor was fairly bland and I’m curious if that’s the dish or if it was something I did. It was really good, just tasted more like tomatoes than anything. I would love input from someone who knows how to cook this dish.

Edit: after reading the comments, here is what I’ve learned: mine was too watery, I need to be more heavy handed with the spices, I can add sugar/honey to cut the tomato acidity and flavor so the spices pop, toasting spices is a thing, and the NYT recipe is just swell.

Bake your own bread for $0.61!!,"I made my first loaf of sandwich bread yesterday and am enjoying toast, sandwiches, and garlic bread on delicious chewy bread. I love homemade bread and used to buy it at farmers markets or bakeries for $4-$6 and decided that was crazy! So I found some recipes for simple sandwich bread and made my own with ingredients I already had: flour, salt, water, yeast, and sugar. Using only minuscule amounts of all of those ingredients compared to the bulk of the container, I spend only $0.61 on my loaf of bread! I shop at Aldi anyways and saved money by purchasing those ingredients and having them on hand. The bread was SO good and will last me and my boyfriend a week. You could even bake a few loaves at a time and freeze them. This is my new favorite way to save $$ and eat healthier--you know exactly what is in the bread (the simplest ingredients EVER) and its not full of preservatives and junk. I know a loaf of wheat bread at Aldi is only $0.80 or so, but this way the bread is fresh, homemade, healthy, and sooooo delicious!! And you have the satisfaction of knowing YOU made it!

Here's the ingredients/ratios I used:

\-500g all purpose flour

\-10g salt

\-8g instant yeast (I used active dry + warm water and sugar to activate)

\-375g room temp water


EDIT: Many if you asked for the instructions for the recipe I used. It came from the book Bread Baking for Beginners by Bonnie O’Hara, the recipe is called “Panned Loaf”. Since it’s a copywrited book I don’t feel comfortable posting a picture of it, but I found a recipe online that is essentially the same!

So I am an 18 year old male, 5’8, and weighing in at 94 pounds.

There, they basically told me to eat more, since the main thing was that I wasn’t eating enough.

In a day I typically eat about 1 small meal of whatever we have, which is mostly leftovers. Just today my lunch was leftover waffles. I really want to fix this and get my weight up to normal, but I have no idea how to. The tiniest thing is too much; for example, 1 small bowl of rice would probably last me a day and make up the only thing I eat.

Spätzle with peas and mushrooms,"This is my first post in this subreddit, please be nice. :)  


This recipe is super easy (failsafe even), vegetarian and will take about 15 minutes to make. You will need:  
\- 400g (0,9 pounds) of fresh Spätzle, or if you can't get those, pasta like penne rigatte will do fine

\- 250g (half a pound) of mushrooms/champignons

\- 250ml (8oz) of 15% fat cream or half and half

\- 3-4 fresh scallions

\- a can of peas (about 300g)

\- salt, pepper, garlic powder and some frozen herbs

&amp;#x200B;

If you use pasta, heat up some water and cook the pasta alongside the sauce according to the packages instructions. Clean and slice the mushrooms and the scallions. Heat a large frying pan with a bit of oil (I used sunflower) and fry the mushrooms and scallions on medium-high heat until the mushrooms have a nice golden brown color (but don't let them become crisp). If you use Spätzle, add them to the pan und fry them for a couple of minutes as well. Add the cream and lower the heat. Add peas, salt, pepper, garlic powder and herbs and let the whole mixture simmer for a couple of minutes. Drain the pasta if you're using some.

And that's it - you've got yourself two to three cheap, healthy and easily made meals.   
For a richer sauce either use whole fat cream or use butter instead of oil. This will be tastier, but also less healthy.  


Hope you enjoy! :)

Breakfast replacing shake,"Hello fellow redditors,

First  of all, I'm sorry if this is not the right subreddit to ask for advice  on these kind of things. I'm looking for a shake or a drink that  replaces a breakfast and provides the needed nutrition to start the day.

Please adhere to this in your recipes. This is a place to share and discuss recipes, and not a place to argue about lifestyles.

What is Meatless Monday? Meatless Monday is not a new idea. During World War I, the U.S. Food Administration urged families to reduce consumption of key staples to aid the war effort. “Food Will Win the War,” the government proclaimed, and “Meatless Monday” and “Wheatless Wednesday” were introduced to encourage Americans to do their part.

What is the point today? Because going meatless once a week may reduce your risk of chronic preventable conditions like cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. And going meatless once a week can also help reduce our carbon footprint and save precious resources like fossil fuels and fresh water.

Probably BigOven came closest, but it has ads and so far most of the recipes I've imported have come out messed up (including from Budgetbytes where I get a ton of recipes).

"Been using MyFitnessPal consistently for 2 months, looking for suggestions","[please let me know if there is a better sub to post this in]

I have diligently tracked all the food I have eaten on MyFitnessPal every day for the months of May and June, and the average balance of my week to week intake is as follows:

*Protein 43g under; *Carbs 30g under; Fibre 18g over; Sugar 7g under; Fat 3g over; Cholesterol 183mg over; Sodium 250mg over; *Potassium 1005mg under; Vitamin A 2.4x DRV; Vitamin C 3x DRV; Calcium 1.25x DRV; Iron 1.3x DRV

I pretty much eat vegan at home (except for 2 eggs every morning), and will eat meat out if I was going to be thrown out had I not eaten it. 

I’m wondering if anyone has any suggestions of how to make up for the gaps in the nutrients with a *. For protein I usually try to include one type of bean/tofu in one meal per day (on top of a protein shake at breakfast), but clearly it’s not adding up. I’m also curious about how I can close my potassium gap, I just bought some coconut water, of which 500ml/day would cover it, though it’s about $1.25 a day. 

Does anyone have any suggestions of good protein bars or other supplements that could close all the starred gaps, of course as cheaply as possible? Thanks in advance.

I have a quick question about brining chicken,"There’s just a lot of opposing information on the web, y’know?

I have two ~1/2lb boneless chicken breasts in the fridge I’d like to brine. 

As far as I understand, I boil kosher salt (some sites said sugar also?) so it dissolves, cool the water, then soak the chicken in the fridge for about 6 hours (some sites say 1/2 hour, some say eight, some 24). 

I work nine hour days with half an hour commute on either side. If I drop the chicken in the brine, stick it in the fridge before I leave (6:30am), then take it out when I’m home and showered (about 6pm), I then.. what? Pat dry it? Then start baking it? 


I think I want to just slice it then add it to maybe sandwiches or this lettuce wrap I want to try and make. I was going to make a rub with whatever the hell I have in my cabinets (rosemary, basil, pepper..?) then just bake it at 450°F for about twenty minutes or until the internal temp is ~125°F. Would this be good, you think? I hate dry chicken and am picky enough that I likely won’t even eat it if it isn’t moist. 

The lettuce wraps I want to try will be chicken, red pepper, jalapeño, pan cooked alfalfa, tomato, and whatever else probably. Think this would taste good? I’m trying to prep a few for the week so I can just grab and go.

I could literally live off pizza... however my wallet does not approve...,"I’ll eat pizza on average 3-5 times a week, maybe more. 
I LOVE it, always changing the toppings, the sauce, the crust, it’s an addiction. 
However between constantly making my own or ordering out, prices add up fast. Something I started doing paid dividends in saving money. 

Picking up 2-3 frozen pizzas a week has really saved my wallet. There’s so many options out there which you’d be surprised how cheap and healthy they can be. 
For example, Tuscan chicken pizza runs about 4 dollars at Aldis, about 1200 calories for the whole pizza. It’s the perfect meal for 2, with pretty reasonable amounts of fats, carbs, proteins, and yes even sodium! 

Having a few frozen pizzas ready to go at a moments notice has helped control urges and save me money, as I have a big tendency to order a pizza after a bad day of work. Spending 4 dollars for a frozen one vs 30 for delivery has been very clutch. 

That’s all.

Instant noodles/ramen question?,"Hello ECAH,

Ramen is a delicious and cheap way to eat. It can also be very easy to add things (proteins such as eggs, even ground beef if you sauté it a bit, canned fish, tofu, frozen vegetables, beans).

However, the flavoring is what makes it unhealthy, a single flavor packet containing sodium that is more than half of RDI. What are some cheap options to flavor it?

Veggie and Chicken Curry Recipe / $1.12 per serving,"$1.12 per serving | Ingredients (Serves 4)

* 1 tbsp. olive oil / 15ml\*
* 1/2 lb. chicken breast / 250g\*
* 1 small yellow onion, diced
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 cup broccoli / 2.3dl\*
* 1/2 cup frozen spinach / 120ml\*
* 1/2 cup frozen mushrooms / 120ml\*
* 14oz. can coconut milk / 4dl\*
* 2 tbsp. mild curry powder / 30ml\*
* 2 cups uncooked basmati rice / 3.6dl\*
* chili flakes - optional
* parsley - optional

\*Indicates metric system measurements

# Rice

Cook basmati rice according to package instructions.

# Chicken Curry

In a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, add olive oil and diced onions. Cook until the onions become slightly translucent. Add in the minced garlic and give it a good stir. Add in curry powder and stir for about 1 minute.

Cut your chicken in small cubes, and add to the wok. Let this cook until all sides begin to brown slightly. Add in coconut milk and bring it to a boil. Let this boil for about 10 minutes.

While that's cooking, I like to remove any water content from my vegetables since I typically use frozen instead of fresh. In a separate pan, cook mushrooms and broccoli until the water that is released evaporates.

Add broccoli, mushrooms and spinach into the wok with the coconut milk. Give it a good stir and taste the curry sauce. You may need to add more curry powder, black pepper, salt, chili flakes, or parsley to your liking.

Serve over rice.

\---

Some notes: I calculated the price with the cheapest coconut milk I could find at my grocery store that's available now, $1.25. Sometimes I can find them on sale for $0.95 and I try to stock up!

I also buy my chicken breast at $4.50 for 2 pounds - to help give more insight.

Everything I use is frozen (besides onion), that's been the cheapest option for me these days. For an extra fresh flavor, I sometimes will also add juice from half a lemon and then boil the lemon half (seeds removed) into the coconut milk. Just make sure to remove the lemon piece before serving.

A couple options I've found:

* Shots... its all around less liquid consumed so it's gotta be ""healthier."" Problem is, I hate shots. And it doesn't work well if you want something to sip
* Whisky on the rocks. Similar idea to shots, but this time it's sippable. But man, I still hate this option... straight liquor is just too rough for me
* White Claws seem like they're pretty ""healthy"" but I'm not sure. I feel like they're not much lower calories than just a regular beer. I'd imagine less sugar though.
* This is probably the best option I've found so far: mixing vodka and flavored sparkling water. Masks the taste pretty well (doesn't just taste watered down like it would with regular water) and the only calories, sugar, etc. are in the liquor itself.

PSA: Bitterness can cut umami/saltiness,"I made a really overly salty mac and cheese because I used a box mac and cheese, canned chicken, and I added a TON of parm (**which is salty for those of you who don't know!**) and seaweed. I added seaweed as an experiment, I'm trying to eat better and it counts as a serving of other veggies. 

I managed to find a website that had an infographic and an explanation of the relationships between different flavors. I had the same issue last time I made mac and cheese because I added parm but it wasn't as bad, but I made a worse mistake by adding balsamic vinegar to balance it out. That's a strong sweet/sour flavor and it turns out that that *brings out* salty/umami flavors according to this website and I unfortunately can attest to that from experience due to the abomination that the balsamic vinegar produced. 

So I saw it said bitter flavors cut out salty/umami and it listed bitter veggies, beer, grapefruit, cocoa and coffee. **So I added a teaspoon of coffee to my mac and cheese, careful to not add too much to avoid tasting it.** And you know what? It worked! It's much more muted, like the flavor was in my face before and now it's taken a solid few steps back! And I don't taste coffee with every bite, which is what I was worried about!

My soulfood - Mom's Tomato Tofu Stirfry,"This recipe is similar to the Chinese egg tomato stir fry but without eggs. My mom used to make it with fried pork belly meat, but since I went meatless, she makes it with tofu for me instead (love you mom!).

For 2 servings:

200g tofu, firm  
Soy sauce  
Lemon juice  
Ginger  
Garlic  
A hot chili or some hot sauce  

Sesame oil  
1 onion  
More ginger and garlic  
4 ripe tomatoes, not the huge watery ones, they should have lots of flavor  
Cilantro  

Jasmin rice  

My mom usually doesn't press or marinate the tofu, but I really like to marinate my tofu the night before and it's amazing, even for tofu haters. 
For this, I combine soy sauce, lemon juice, chopped ginger, pressed garlic and a sliced chili (or just some Sriracha). I press the tofu slightly, then cut in rectangled blocks (about 5x2x1cm or thinner if you don't like spongy tofu) and put it in the marinade freezer bag in the fridge overnight. 

In the pan with oil (best is sesame) I fry the marinated tofu until it browns (dont move until you see the sides brown and the size shrinking) from both sides. If you do thinner slices, the tofu gets a seitan like consistency. 
I remove the tofu pieces and fry chopped onions with another pressed garlic clove and some ginger slices in the remainder oil. If you don't like to eat ginger do still add it but remove it later, it's necessary for the taste. The tofu is added back with chopped tomatoes. I also add some of the marinade back to taste so it's not too salty. This is now cooked and occasionally stirred on low heat until the tomatoes have disintegrated and reduced. This also adds umami taste because tomato is rich in glutamate. Last I mix in chopped cilantro (sometimes spring onions) and serve over rice.

Recipe here originally: [Tilapia and Bacon in Garlic Broth](https://triedtrue.us/TilapiaBacon)

### Grade

Serves: 4

Cost: $

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 45 minutes

### Ingredients for Tilapia and Bacon in Garlic Broth

4 tilapia fillets, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper

8 ounces thick sliced bacon, sliced into lardons

2 tablespoons butter

4 carrots, peeled and small diced

2 stalks celery, small diced

1 small onion, peeled and small diced

6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

4 cups chicken stock

1 teaspoon paprika, plus more for serving

1 lemon, sliced into 4 rounds

8 ounces fresh or frozen peas

½ cup fresh parsley leaves, minced

Salt and pepper to taste

Sprinkle of crushed red pepper, optional

Extra virgin olive oil, optional, for serving

### Method

###### Fry the Bacon:

Preheat oven to 400ºF.

In a large, wide braising pot (large enough to hold all the fish fillets), add the bacon and turn the heat on the stove to medium-high. Cook for 8-10 minutes or until the fat has rendered. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a bowl. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon bacon fat.

###### Cook the Vegetables:

Return the pot to medium heat and add 2 tablespoons butter. Once melted, add the carrots, celery, and onion and cook, stirring regularly, for 7-8 minutes or until the vegetables begin to soften.

Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds or until fragrant.

###### Prepare the Broth:

Add the chicken stock and the reserved bacon and bring to a boil. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika.

###### Cook the Tilapia:

Place the tilapia fillets in the broth and sprinkle a little paprika on top of each fillet. Place a lemon round on each fillet and transfer to the oven. Cook for 15 minutes or until the fish is opaque and cooked through.

###### Finish the Broth:

Using a spatula, carefully transfer the tilapia fillets to 4 shallow bowls.

Turn the heat on the broth to medium and add the peas and parsley. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until the peas are bright green. Taste and  season one final time with salt, pepper, or crushed red pepper if desired. Turn off the heat.

###### To Serve:

Ladle the hot broth over the tilapia and sprinkle each dish with a bit of paprika and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, if desired. Enjoy!

# Modifications

There are a few modifications you could make that I think would help this go further:

Serve over rice

* Add a can of white beans before adding the fish
* Add potatoes to the broth and cook a bit longer before adding fish (might need more water/broth)
* You could roast some veggies (potatoes, zucchini, broccoli) and serve it on the side!

Here are a few substitutions, too:

* Tilapia: Cod, haddock, or any other firm white fish – You could even use shrimp.
* Veggies: You could add zucchini (mix and match with the carrots, celery, peas)
* Bacon: Omit and add something like beans. You can also use chorizo if you feel like being fancy!

For me, I was pleasantly surprised with how nice this dish turned out considering I was using veggies that were going to be thrown away if I didn't use them! Hope you all like this recipe!",EatCheapAndHealthy

I've tried to do this on my own and I get so stressed out while shopping that we just end up with the same processed crap, and pasta.

Noodles!,"Hello

I have lurked on this sub for a long time but I wanted to post my new favourite lunch. Cheap, healthy (I think) and QUICK!

Basically create-your-own Super Noodles!

I start with some thin egg noodles and put them in a pan with 250ml of water. Once the water is nearly all soaked up into the delicious noodles, I then put a sauce (I'm using black bean at the mo!) in with peas and sweetcorn - but you can put anything in! I've done broccoli, cauliflower, cashews... Anything really.

Alternatively when you put the water it, put a load of seasoning: Italian, Pepper, Salt, curry powder or even a stock cube. All that tasty liquid will get soaked up!

&amp;#x200B;

Finally if you wanted an extra bit of protein, throw in an egg at the last minute, stir it round and serve :)

&amp;#x200B;

I served it over roasted cauliflower and sliced red onion (the remaining red onion from the meatballs).

## Grade

Serves: 4

Cost: $

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 40 minutes (20 minutes inactive)

## Ingredients for Sour Cream and Onion Chicken Meatballs

**Chicken Meatballs**

1 pound ground chicken

5 cloves garlic, peeled

¼ red onion, peeled

1 small red cherry pepper, trimmed

2 tablespoons mayonnaise

1 teaspoon dry dill

¾ teaspoon salt

¾ cup garbanzo bean flour, plus more if necessary (or breadcrumbs)

A few shakes of pepper

2 tablespoons neutral cooking oil

**Sour Cream and Onion Sauce**

1 cup sour cream (can use Greek yogurt or low-fat sour cream)

½ cup chicken stock, plus more water as needed

1 teaspoon dry dill

½ teaspoon dry chives, plus more to taste

½ teaspoon onion powder, plus more to taste

Salt and pepper to taste

**For Serving**

Roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes

## Method

## Prepare The Chicken Meatballs:

In a food processor, combine the garlic, red onion, and cherry pepper. Pulse until minced and transfer to a large mixing bowl.

To the mixing bowl, add the ground chicken along with the remaining ingredients (except the cooking oil) for the chicken meatballs and use your hands to combine, being careful not to overmix.

Form the meatballs into tablespoon-sized balls and transfer to a plate. Place in the freezer for 10 minutes.

## Fry the Meatballs:

In a wide skillet, heat the 2 tablespoons neutral cooking oil over medium heat until very hot. Add the meatballs and cook for 3-4 minutes or until golden brown. Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes. Continue cooking for 12-15 minutes, flipping every 3-4 minutes until the meatballs are just about cooked through.

Pour the chicken stock in to the skillet and whisk in the sour cream. Once the sour cream is incorporated into the stock, season with salt, pepper, dill, chives, and onion powder.

Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes or until the sauce is thickened, adding more water as necessary, to loosen up the sauce.

## To Serve:

Serve the chicken meatballs with the sour cream and onion sauce over roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes.

Not the most relevant but wanted to ask here. Can someone live off a weekly CSA (community supported agriculture) box?,"Or are those produce boxes meant to supplement not supplant your groceries especially considering the fact that they don't include staples like bread, beans and rice (maybe potatoes but not enough to serve as a staple) as well as spices that would add a lot of flavor in such dishes?

Speaking of CSA (community supported agriculture) boxes, not that I plan to get any soon myself (though honestly, I'm not in a position right now for that), could they sere as a tool to eat cheap and healthy or it depends (some are affordable, some are expensive and there may be issues with each service, not to mention issues like spoilage)? This is more of a hypothetical, but do you think it'd be a good idea if the government funded a weekly CSA (community agriculture box) to people on programs like SNAP/EBT (either to replace/supplement the program)?

More filling meals and ways to spice up eggs?,"Hi everyone, I've been struggling the past few weeks keeping my diet in check and it's starting to give me GI issues. With school being out and not having a real structure to my days anymore, I've been eating more (somewhat intentional) and not as well as I should be (not intentional). 

My days usually started with overnight oats made from powdered PB, raisins, and a protein powder for breakfast. I'd then be gone and not eat again for 13 or 14 hours (after school and working out), but that structure is gone now. 

I know part of the issue is having having more free time and my tendency to eat when I get bored. I'm trying to fix that by getting back into doing more artwork and potentially get a business setup for a friend. 

I'm kinda looking for two things I guess. Either something that I can snack on that has very very little or no calories to it, or a way to make that breakfast more filling now.

Can't make the switch from 0 effort to healthy food,"Hi

I just can't seem to make the switch from no-prep food to anything involving effort or dishes. For supper, all I do is frozen chicken strips, fries, and frozen veggies (which I generally have to force myself to eat because I don't like how soggy they become). Out of bag, onto pan, shove in the oven. Rinse, repeat. I can eat the same food for months on end, but I really want to try and switch to something healthier and more interesting. And maybe even something I can eat as leftovers the day after.

I've tried to switch to something healthier, but even things like chicken breasts just sit in my freezer. The step of defrosting it before putting it in the oven just never happens, so they never get eaten.

The most I prep are sandwiches for lunch. Even that is - take bread slice, spread mayo, put pre-packaged chicken chunks on it, put cheese slice on, put kale leaf on. Outside of that, it's either prepackaged food or food I can take out of the bag and eat (ex trail mix, pre-cut carrots and broccoli). I buy a full broccoli to cut up for roasting, it just rots away in my fridge.

&amp;#x200B;

I find it really upsetting and frustrating. I've gained a lot of weight due to eating out, which is what generally happens when I buy a mix of no-prep food and prep food, and run out of no-prep food. It also goes against my values of reducing waste. Right now I'm working full-time which I find exhausting, and that's part of the problem right now, but I've also historically struggled just in general. If I don't have any no-prep food, I'll just lie in bed until I get hungry enough to order delivery, or walk out and buy something from a store/restaurant/cafe already prepared.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice with getting over the psychological speedbump of prepping food, and/or any other 0 prep recipes that are healthier and more interesting than what I'm currently doing would be helpful. Thanks.",EatCheapAndHealthy

Thank you so much to everyone, and I hope anyone else who may stumble across this post can benefit too! :)**

**Edit 2: holy crap this took off. I'm feeling the smoothie love! Cannot wait to try some oats in my shake tomorrow!**

Hey guys!

Let me preface this by saying... this has to be one of my all-time favorite subs.  I browse and sift through the posts here on the daily.  You all are so full of amazing, helpful knowledge and have, without a doubt, helped me become more aware and conscious of how I eat and shop.  **Thank you so much.**

Smoothies.  It's probably beaten to death (sorry), but I wondered how I could make my smoothies a little more affordable. 

I find cereal or oatmeal simply do not keep me full until lunch, and I so easily get bored, or just can't stick with them for more than a few weeks.  I'm just not an oatmeal person!  I do love Weetabix + soymilk + fruit, so that is a staple I can do, and maybe add two boiled eggs, but by 10am I'm basically starving and need a snack.

I'm a morning person and have breakfast by 7am.  These smoothies I make get me to 12-1pm easy, which I never thought was possible.  I have been able to eliminate snacks (mid morning and after lunch even) because I just generally feel fuller.  So, I do save time and money by no longer worrying about snacks. 

SO!  To break it down, this is what I do (approx. cost per serving per day in Canada):

- Kazien Vanilla Protein Powder (Costco; 1 scoop serving): $1.00
- Plain yogurt (1/4 - 1/2 cup): $0.60
- Frozen fruit: $0.50 
- Banana: $0.30 
- Soy milk: $0.80
- Baby spinach: $1.00

So, approximately $4.20 for breakfast.  But I can halve that, do you think?  I've tried to minimize ingredients already but I find if one of these components is missing, it kind of ruins the texture/taste!  Instead of removing components, maybe I can substitute with different things...

I can easily sub out the soy milk for water, so lets say now the smoothie costs me $3.40.

What other shortcuts can I take?  Or do I just eat the cost of a $3-4.00 smoothie and come to peace with it by having cut out snacks?

When browsing I saw a crazy but possibly brilliant suggestion of subbing protein powder for beans, white beans in particular.  Has anyone done this?  Any drawbacks?  I am afraid that cutting the protein powder will take away that filling-factor that keeps me going until lunch.  Certainly worth a try! 

I know it doesn't seem like much, but really, if I can save a few cents on a meal per day, and reduce my grocery bill, it will vastly help my weekly and monthly budgeting.  Shout out to YNAB!!

If you are or were a student and have ANY other tips, I would love to hear!  I own my home so obviously will be living here and commuting to school, so I don't have to worry about fridge, freezer or pantry space, at least! :)

"Trying to eat healthier, unsure if I'm succeeding","Hi! so I want to start eating healthier. This becomes a problem because I'm an extremely picky eater and so the foods I eat that would be considered healthy are small (bordering to nonexistent). However, my current diet is mostly pizza for lunch and pasta for dinner everyday. I've tried eating grilled chicken in the past and I honestly hate it. Every time I go back to eating it to try and be healthier, i remember why i stopped trying to eat healthy. That said, for a while i was trying to use fitness trackers and i never realized how many calories pizza had (or at least, the amount I was eating). It's mostly frozen pizza too.

Recently I've been making homemade chicken cutlets using plain breadcrumbs and vegetable oil (though one of my friends told me olive oil is better so I'll be switching soon). My question is basically is the homemade chicken cutlets any healthier than pizza? I know fried things aren't healthy in general but am I moving in the right direction? I'm pretty set on having spaghetti with meatballs every night for dinner as it's cheap, easy to make, and I really enjoy it. So I'm mostly looking to just replace the pizza as much as I can.

Super easy and cheap tomato risotto recipe,"I have several cheap go-to recipes, and this is probably my favourite! This recipe makes 2 pretty big portions. I always have the ingredients for this on hand, since I buy several cans of chopped tomatoes for my weekly shop and always stock up on onions and garlic anyway. 

I'm gonna list an estimate for the price of each ingredient in GBP at my local Tesco, not sure how much things cost in countries other than England.

Ingredients:
1 medium onion (red or white, whichever you have) ~ 15p 
2-3 garlic cloves ~ 15p 
1 can of chopped tomatoes ~ 50p 
160g risotto rice (I use Arborio) ~ 1kg of this is £2 at Tesco, so 160g is 32p 
600ml vegetable broth ~ I use one stock cube, which costs about 15p 
a big dash of olive oil ~ no idea, maybe 2p if you use relatively cheap olive oil? 
Salt and pepper 

Optional but definitely recommend if you're not vegan: 
1 ball of buffalo mozzarella ~ 45p 

Total cost (including Mozarella): 
£1.74 or 87p per portion (that's something like 1 USD) 


Recipe: 

1. To prep: Finely chop garlic and onion. Boil the kettle or heat 600ml water in a pot, then dissolve your stock cube or stock powder in the water. 

2.  In a large, wide-based non-stick pan heat the olive oil on medium heat. Then add the onion with a bit of salt and cook for a few minutes. 

3.  Add the risotto rice and garlic. Mix well until the rice is evenly coated with oil. Then add the can of tomatoes and stir until the rice has absorbed most of the tomato ""juice"". 

4. Add the stock one ladle at a time. Stir continuously. Every time you add stock, stir and stir and stir and don't add more stock until the rice has absorbed most of it. This should take about 20 minutes. The stirring is really important because it makes the risotto creamy, and that's kinda the whole point. 

5. Once that's all done, add salt and pepper to taste (the stock is already salty so you might not even need added salt).  

6. Serve in two bowls with chopped buffalo mozarella on top. 



Disclaimer: This isn't my own recipe or anything, I read it somewhere one time, made it and wrote down the steps on a piece of paper as I was doing it.

Pan-Seared Tofu,"This recipe comes courtesy of my mom, who’s never used Reddit before but does love cheap and healthy cooking. Coming from a non-vegetarian Chinese guy, this stuff is f-ing delicious. It’s a super easy vegetarian protein, and all you need is a non-stick pan, a block of tofu, oil, salt, and soy sauce. 

**Prep Time:** 10 minutes

**Cook Time:** 15 minutes

**Ingredients:**
-  1 package of firm tofu
-  1-2 tablespoons oil
-  Salt
-  1 tbsp soy sauce
-  1 tbsp water
-  1/2 tbsp sugar (optional)
-  2-3 green onions, cut into inch-long segments and halved (optional)
-  1 tbsp [Lao Gan Ma](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Bean-Chilli-Sauce-280g/dp/B0051D84GI) (Chili Oil with Black Beans) (optional but wow it tastes good)

1. Cut tofu in half vertically/lengthwise, then again parallel to the cutting board, then horizontally across into slices
2. Heat non-stick saute pan over medium-high heat and add oil
3. Place tofu into pan when oil is hot (not smoking)
4. **Don’t stir the tofu** and leave a little space between each square
5. Add salt to the top of the tofu
6. When the bottom edges turn golden brown or when the tofu releases from the pan, flip the tofu one-by-one in order of original placement (if too soft to flip, let it cook longer)
7. Once the other side of the tofu is brown, add green onions to pan, lower heat, and cover; allow tofu to take in the flavor for 2-3 minutes
8. Add soy sauce, water, Lao Gan Ma, and some sugar, and stir tofu to coat

**Tl;dr:** put firm tofu into a pan, sear each side to golden brown perfection, add a splash of soy sauce if you want, and serve.",EatCheapAndHealthy

"If you haven’t had a tuna salad quesadilla , you need to try this cheap and easy snack.","Grab some large tortillas about 2-2.50
4 pack of tuna for 2 bucks
You can use whatever cheese you have, either slices or shredded. I recommend American and cheddar but you can use anything, really.

Preheat oven to 400(f)

Mix a can of tuna with about 2 tablespoons of mayo. You can stretch one can per 2 quesadillas, especially if you use a vegetable (I use green beans, canned and drained) to add some sustenance.

Mix your vegetables and tuna salad

Layer your cheese on one side of the tortilla (I’d use about 2-3 slices or a half cup of shredded cheese)
 Spoon on the tuna/veggie mixture, then cover with another half cup or 2/3 slices of cheese.

Fold the  other side and press down firmly, making sure everything is nice and even.

Spray one side lightly with cooking spray, and place the quesadilla sprayed side down on a cooking tray. Do the same with your other quesadilla(s) if you decided to scale the recipe for more. Again, half a can of tuna+ veggies, 4/5 slices or 1 cup of shredded cheese per quesadilla.

Put in the oven for about 10 minutes, around the 9 minute mark, check on them and make sure they aren’t burning but by this point they should have some browning.

Quick question on frozen fruit.,"Okay so I bought a few bags of mixed fruit the other day, a variety of types. One of them being a strawberry and banana mix. When I opened the bag I accidentally cut too far along the resealable line and ruined the bag. So I moved the contents into a freezer safe Ziploc. Now a few days later I'm seeing the bananas start to change color and also if I look on the bottom of the bag where the berries are settling. There appears to be a syrup from the strawberries forming. I'm starting to wonder if my freeze isn't capable of actually freezing the fruits because I can squeeze the strawberries in the bag no problem and they're not actually frozen. Is it possible that the thicker Ziploc is interfering with the ability to freeze the fruit? I even turned my freezer down to -6, its lowest setting, and a day later there is no change. I also have a new bag of frozen berries that is unopened and I squeezed a berry in it to see how soft/frozen they are and they're roughly the same. How hard should a frozen fruit be exactly?

Something better than chia - for magnesium,"I used to be magnesium deficient, which manifested in a progressing dystonia, as well as constipation.

I started taking Mg tablets for it. Then, recently, I decided to switch to some food - to get the Mg in a natural way.

Things I tried:

- Flaxseed - cheap, but felt heavy in my stomach, and worsened the constipation
- Pumpkin seeds - same problems as flaxseed, I think
- Cashew and almonds - too expensive for an everyday food
- Chia seeds  - that's what I'm eating now. 100gr/day.

The problem with chia is that I'm not buying it organic. And there's really no way to wash chia (that I know of), since it absorbs huge amounts of water. So I guess I'm taking in a crapload of pesticides with that chia.

Cheap and healthy snack ideas for young children on summer break?,"Hey everyone. I have three young kids who are on break from school. They have been eating tons of snacks-- chips, cheese curls, fruit gummies, and so on, and it's really starting to affect our grocery bill. Unfortunately they are rather picky, so we are a bit stuck.

How do you spice your quiche?,"
So, I've been practicing pie crusts this spring. I've finally got it nailed and stopped buying pre-made. I've been making pot pies and dessert pies and even some hand pies. Lately I've added quiche. 

I've never been overly fond of my own quiche. It tastes too bland to me. I'm down with adding all the extras--onion, cheese, spinach, mushroom, ham--but I feel like there's some spice I'm missing. Something that would take the egg/milk/custard to a different level.

Advice/Feedback - Trying to cook healthy and made a recipe.,"**Introduction**

I've spent a few years just buying frozen food (pizza, chips, hash browns) and just frying or heating it.

I'm trying to learn how to cook healthy food and I've been lurking and saving posts containing recipes and advice.

I've taken a look at what's in my kitchen and I'm thinking of making white rice, diced chicken breast in tomato sauce.

I haven't really cooked in a while so I've been looking around online and planning out exactly how I'll make it.

Ideas for carb replacement meals?,"Hi all,
Long time listener, first time caller and all that. 

So—I read the mod post on using the search bar before asking questions, but I truly didn’t find what I was looking for, so I’ll ask.

I recently made an eggplant-based instead of noodle-based lasagna (which also had 0 meat and as a carnivore myself, I can say it was quite tasty), for which I don’t have a recipe because I sort of winged it. 

I also just made cauliflower crust pizza, for which I won’t post a recipe because that stuff is super Internet famous (rightfully so—it is delicious). 

I’m kind of digging this whole carb-substitute recipe thing. I’ve found a cauliflower taco tortilla recipe and will be trying that soon (sorry, vegans and vegetarians: that’s definitely happening with carnitas).

What I’m wondering is: does anyone here have any recipes for other “replace X carb with Y veggie-based thing” that are obviously cheap and healthy, along the lines of the cauliflower pizza?

I’ve felt almost no need to have the carbs found on the dishes I described above, so I’m trying to make it so that I hardly ever have to resort to carbs whenever I crave a carb-heavy meal. 

Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go back to my beer (you gotta pick your vices, you know).",EatCheapAndHealthy

"Almost 30... I’ve been eating unhealthy my entire life. Fast food, hamburger helpers, and indulging in desserts are all I’ve known since childhood.","I have been been raised on a poor diet. When I moved out of my parents house at 20 not much changed. I just kept cooking, buying, and eating things I’ve always known. Basically convenience foods. Vegetables? What are those?

Now I’m a couple years from 30 and my body has caught up with a lifetime of poor diet. 

I was watching a YouTube video today where a doctor tried different burgers to compare a beef burger to non beef alternatives in a blind test. At the end he basically said that after looking at the nutritional facts of them all, he wouldn’t consider the non beef alternatives as “health food” and suggested even the non beef burgers be eaten in the same way beef burgers are... as an indulgence. 

Indulgence. It’s like it clicked for me. Most of the foods I eat regularly are foods normal, healthy people would consider indulging. Burgers, pizza, Chinese take out, tacos, pasta dishes, etc. 

But when I tried to jump into google research I can’t seem to find any help in learning what a normal healthy diet is suppose to look like in a day to day life. I know this changes based on location, and if that helps at all, I live in the Southeastern USA. 

I need some help. Can someone just throw some suggestions out about what should be eaten daily? Cooking isn’t the problem for me, just basic knowledge of what to cook and what to eat is. How do I train my pallet to like more veggies and less processed foods?

Edit: Wow. So many responses in such a short time. Kind of wish I posted this on my main account now but I was so embarrassed about this post. This community is so nice though, so thank you all so much. 

I am still reading through the comments but I want to point out a couple things that have come up. 

-I’m female and my work isn’t active. 

-I’m not broke per se, but definitely not rolling in money, I just chose this subreddit because it seemed the one that made the most sense to post in. 

-To piggy back on the previous point, while seeing a nutritionist would be amazing, I live in a rural area, so there aren’t any readily available at the grocery store or general physician’s office. I am currently self employed (freelancing) and do not have any health insurance. Bummer for sure. 

-I briefly mentioned at the end of my post that cooking isn’t a problem for me. What I mean is not only am I comfortable with cooking, I also have time to cook and actually kind of enjoy it. Meal prepping isn’t something I’m interested in just yet, but I appreciate the advice on how to meal prep and I’ll probably use it one day. 

Now I just need to get on my computer and bookmark some of these amazing recipes, find a bargain for a pressure cooker and air fryer, and looking into some of these books. Maybe call around and find the nearest nutritionalist who isn’t expensive without insurance. 

Thank you all again!!",EatCheapAndHealthy

1: Kale (or other leafy green of your choice), blueberries, banana, greek yogurt, oats

2: Banana, protein powder, oats, peanut butter (or other nut butter of your choice), milk

Vegan-ish recipes for gaining weight?,"I have been vegetarian since about ever and went vegan around 2 years ago. Three months ago, my doctor told me I would profit from gaining some weight - nothing serious, but 3 or so more kilogram would be good. Since then, I tried and failed.
I tried eating more meals and also meals richer in calories, but that just resulted in me putting more margarine or vegan cheese into everything. Then I went back to eating cheese and eggs again, but to no avail - my meals were just fattier and I felt like I were eating even less. Also, adding these fats didn't exactly feel like improving my diet health-wise. :D

Partner brought up on a diet of processed foods and meat. Straight up refuses vegetables.,"Edit: please stop telling me to ‘leave him’, if your best friend or your mother or father, sister, brother were basically killing themselves with food. You’d also be desperate to help.

Hey there, tl;dr my partner (M/24) is a very unhealthy eater, which is heavily affecting my (F/21) diet choices and health. I need advice on how to introduce vegetables and healthy eating on a tight budget ($50 p/w) 

He was brought up in a a household with a single parent that had minimal money and no knowledge of basic cooking or foods. As a child if he didn’t ‘like’ something he wasn’t made to eat it and would refuse to try things. His mother has even told me that he went through a stage from the ages of 3-5 only eating plain white bread, pasta and tuna or chicken nuggets as a dinner/lunch. 

When we go shopping I will actively suggest that we make up a list or look up a recipe to make that he will enjoy. Something that includes at LEAST two vegetables. This often becomes an argument as we are on an incredibly tight budget, so I give up and let him have his way. We will then proceed to buy noodles, bread/cheese/can of baked beans for ‘toasties’ (which I add vegetables to my own) or a freezer isle meal. Usually frozen chips or chicken pieces. He will then buy ‘munchies’ usually two to three kinds of confectionary and a 2litre soft drink or milk, which he will drink all in the space of that night.

I am beginning to get increasingly worried about both his and my long-term health and how this is potentially affecting our relationship. Neither of us are overweight due to how little we actually eat and I feel like that’s half the contributor to him not caring.

I need some advice or ideas on how I am supposed to tackle this as I am now at my wits end.",EatCheapAndHealthy

Creating a Motivational Page for Health/Fitness.

Or do you have any reflections you want to share during your fitness/health journey that you wished you have realized sooner?

I am planning to create a motivational page on what I want to see in my life (or the direction I want my life to be in). In this case, being healthy, and just not viewing unhealthy habits (like junk food &amp; not exercising) to be something I crave/desire for.

I believe that I could reach my goal faster if I keep reminding myself every day: What I want to be and why. And I need some motivation to do. I believe that motivation can occur if I keep reminding myself every morning of why I'm doing this, similar to hygiene, you gotta take a shower every day to be clean.

Did you grow up eating fufu? What was it made of and how did you eat it and with what? Did you ever have cornmeal fufu? Is fufu ever filled like a tamale? Do you still make fufu now as a adult? How do you eat it now?

Help me get my husband to like sardines!,"I love sardines and could eat them plain on toast but my husband thinks their gross (he doesn't mind the taste as much, but he can't get behind the idea of eating fish bones).

Homemade tomato juice,"First post here, not sure if you guys like tomato juice as much as i do but I figured id share this just in case. It’s good for you and makes a great in between meal snack!

You only really need 4 or 5 tomatoes, half an onion, hot sauce, and pinch of salt and pepper. Total, I think I made a weeks supply for about $10 at Walmart. 

All you do is chop everything to dime or nickel size pieces and simmer it all, covered, for about a half hour. Then, chill for a bit in the fridge and have at it! 

The hot sauce is up to you how much you use. Take caution if you use something with a bolder flavor like Tabasco, you don’t want to overpower everything. I even add green chiles to mine because the capsaicin is super good for your metabolism.

The best part is, you can use the leftover stewed tomatoes and onions for a quick meal i usually mix them with rice and beans.

For low/moderate sodium diets: Pringles?,"Low sodium diets can be a difficult flavorless slog, particularly for shelf-stable unrefrigerated snacks.

To determine whether it's appropriate food, I like to just compare the ratio of calories to milligrams of sodium.  If it's close to 1:1, consistently, over all meals, you end up in just about the right spot.\*  One of the frustrating things for my family members who make a halfhearted attempt to labor under these restrictions, is that even in something like a sandwich, where flavorful salty fillings make bland bread entertaining, in an American supermarket the bread itself is nearly always between 1:1.3 and 1:1.8.

I was sort of shocked that pringles chips (both original and sour cream and onion, the only ones that matter) are at 150 calories : 160 mg sodium.  Literally healthier than plain bread, in this limited context, and successfully standing in flavor-wise on satisfying cravings for foods at 1:3 or 1:4, foods that would squash their sodium budget for the whole day.

\*PS: Adding oil &amp; butter to dishes things ends up being a fairly effective tactic, bulking out the quantity of food with something that tastes good, has zero sodium, and doesn't spike blood sugar; Obviously Pringles are going to be carb-heavy, but blood sugar is not the current highest-order-concern health-wise for my family members.",EatCheapAndHealthy

"Cheap, healthy, filling Mexican breakfast/lunch","I had this dish at a restaurant and knew I had to try making it at home. They called it huaraches (sandals) because the tortillas are shaped like the soles of shoes. However when making it at home I find it easier to make round tortillas especially if using a press. This recipe will make plenty left over so you can easily assemble them each morning later in the week. Here's what you need:


**Tortillas:**
- Masa harina

**Refried beans:**
- Dry pinto beans
- Lard or oil
- Onion
- Jalapeño (optional but recommended)
- Cumin, salt, pepper

**Chicken:**
- Frozen/fresh chicken breast
- Oil (vegetable or olive)
- Salt &amp; pepper

**Optional toppings:**
- Salsa Verde (recipe below)
- Cilantro
- Lime juice
- Chopped onion

**Directions:**

The night before, soak 1lb(~500g) of pinto beans and prepare a brine solution (16:1 Water/salt) for 4-5 chicken breasts to soak/thaw in the fridge overnight. The next morning, cook the pinto beans low and slow for 1.5 - 2 hours and add salt towards the end. You want them to be soft and creamy. When the beans are almost ready, heat the oven to 400F (205C). Rub the chicken with oil and pepper, and bake in the oven on a sheet until they are 165F (74C). Check them at 25 minutes and in 5 minute intervals after that until they are done.

While the chicken bakes, get started on the tortillas. Follow the directions on the masa package to make dough for ~15 tortillas. Cook them on a skillet on medium-high and set the completed ones on a plate with a towel. After tortillas are done, start on the beans. Add 1-2 tablespoons lard/oil to the skillet and saute a chopped onion (or half an onion and 1 jalapeño) until soft and translucent. Add salt, pepper, cumin to taste. Add the beans (if there's too much for your size pan, save them for other dishes or more refried beans later) and mash with potato masher while adding a little water until smooth. Scoop the refried beans out into a container. When the chicken is done baking, let it rest for 5 minutes and then chop it into little cubes. 

To assemble, take a corn tortilla, spread a layer of refried beans on it, and top with the chopped chicken breast. Add any additional toppings. I like to make my own salsa verde with [this recipe](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/tomatillo_salsa_verde/) but the other three toppings listed will be just as good instead.

Store the tortillas, beans, and chicken in containers in the fridge and you can assemble and microwave this easily whenever you want it. The chicken will be good for 4 days.",EatCheapAndHealthy

My advice is to take the rice cooker money and spend it on something else, like a blender, toaster, or a good pot or pan.

"This thick blended vegetable soup is a total game changer -- cheap, easy, and healthy","Okay, fuckin look: 

Pros: 
- Simple
- Cheap
- Flexible
- Delicious hot or cold

Cons: difficult to take to work

It's really simple, y'all.  You don't even need to buy broth. Basic recipe goes like this:

1. Peel and cut whatever vegetables you want, put them in a big pot of water. Small chunks = done sooner. Unless you want the soup to be thin, the water should be less than an inch above the top of veggies.

2. Add whatever spices you want.

3. Boil for about 20-30 minutes.

4. Put in an immersion blender (listen, this thing is the shit and definitely worth it in the long run) and blend all that goodness AND YOU'RE FUCKING DONE. 

If you're feeling extra fancy, add some fresh chopped cilantro/parsley/chives at the end.

For step 1, bare minimum is onion, celery, carrots, and potatoes (last two are the bulk of it). Garlic and ginger are highly recommended. Sweet potatoes or yams are an awesome addition to the bulk part. Butternut squash makes it absolutely amazing, don't even need yams in that case. Can also add peppers, tomatoes, whatever. 

For step 2, I usually use salt, ground black pepper, ground cumin, paprika, and nutmeg. But honestly, just add whatever you think will be good.

Most recipes for sweet potato or butternut squash soup online say you gotta use broth or stock. Screw that! You'll be making vegetable broth when you're boiling the veggies. I've made it with store-bought broth once and couldn't tell the difference.

Excluding the cost of spices, the whole big pot will cost you under $20 and will last a whole week. 

If you don't have an immersion blender but do have a regular one, then you gotta first take all the cooked veggies out, let them cool down a bit, and then blend them in several batches.

I've made this soup many times and every time I'm surprised by how tasty it is.",EatCheapAndHealthy

* 1/2-1tsp cinnamon
* Same amount tumeric
* And cumin
* Diced red pepper (if you have) 
* Bouillon/broth
* 1 tbsp peanut butter

Dice onion, garlic and add to soup pot with a little fat (I included my spinach stems here). Cook til soft. Add red curry paste. Add other spices. Cook to bring out flavors. Add 2-3cups black beans. Add roasted veggies (about 2.5cups). Add diced red pepper and any other veggies that you have. Add 4-6cups water and bouillon. Bring to a boil. Add peanut butter mixed with some warm water. Remove half the beans and veggies. Blend remaining soup with stick blender. Add veggies and beans back. 


Garnish with crushed peanuts, lime and cilantro (I didn't have cilantro. Big bummer).

Eating through the pantry before we move,"My boyfriend and I are moving in two weeks and don’t want to take a full freezer and pantry with us.

In the pantry we have lots of rice, pasta, quinoa, beans, soup, ramen, etc. We want to eat as much as we can without shopping.

What are your go-to cheap and healthy snacks to put a stop to hunger and buy you another hour before your next meal?,"Hey guys,

I want to start working out more, and the only time I can do this is after work. The only way I can realistically pull this off is if I have the right thing to eat prior to the workout, or else it just won’t happen, because working in healthcare + having an annoyingly fast metabolism = ravenous hunger and feeling dead after work. I have to eat a lighter lunch at work (like black beans, quinoa, spicy roasted tomatoes and avocado all mixed together) or else I go into a food coma before I can finish seeing the rest of my patients that day. 

I’m sick of protein bars and trail mix. Looking for any cheap, easy snack suggestions whether it’s a recipe or something simple that can be bought at the store. Think of things that have helped YOU feel good. Something that will boost energy and help the stomach to stop growling.

Sweet Spirulina And Spinach Apple Cider Vinegar Smoothie(For those who take ACV),"**Ingredients:**

¼ teaspoon spirulina

1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

1 tablespoon honey

2 cups spinach leaves

1 cup ice

2 cups chamomile tea

&amp;#x200B;

**How to Prepare**

Combine all the ingredients in a blender. Blend all the ingredients on high until thoroughly combined.  Consume immediately.

**Why This Works**

Raw spinach is often considered the star of a simple salad plate. The nutritious deep-green leaf can be added to a variety of dishes and drinks. The combination of ACV’s enzymes that promote gut health, help prevent infection, and reduce inflammation,  with spinach makes for the perfect ACV drink addition for improvement of digestive health.

"Rice Bowl ""Meal Prep"" Recipes","Love the posts and recipes I've been seeing on this sub so far, but I'm unable to eat some of the stuff most suggested sadly :( so I ask you for help!

I'm looking for easy, flavorful proteins and veggies I can use to top off a rice bowl (or pasta bowl if it's easy to make and tasty) which I can use to take for lunch. Although, I'm limited to what foods I can eat. The big ones which I have to work around are beans since I'm allergic and I can only eat 'religiously cut' meat (AKA Halal). I have access to chicken, ground beef, and some frozen meats, but not a whole lot and I'd like to have more veggie based dishes anyways.

What I can't eat (and maybe don't like):

* Most legumes

I'm allergic to most beans and legumes in somewhat large quantities, but some legumes like lentils are OK.

* Pork (religious)
* Turkey (not a fan)

What I Like to Eat:

* Spinach
* Eggs
* Bell Peppers
* Rice (i can eat this everyday and still love it.)
* Pasta
* Onion
* Peanut Butter
* Fish
* Curries

I prefer these items, but I'm open to trying some new stuff too. I also have South Asian heritage, so dishes with that flavor will be a HUGE plus for me!

I need advices...i know what to eat but not how much i should.,"Hi,

I’m not sure if this is the place...

January 2018 : weight 235 pounds, height 5’7
February 2018 : started eating well (lot of fish, rice, veggies, no precessed food/sugar, only water, etc.)
June 2018: weight ~190 pounds // started working out everyday
November/december 2018: lowest weight 147 pounds.
Since i’ve “permitted” myself to eat more in order to gain more muscle, so:
June 16th 2019 : ~163 pounds.

I dont wanna loose more weight or necessary gain more, but i feel like i have too much fat yet on my abs, chest, lats. I know i have a bit of loose skin there too, but should i diet to gain muscle again, bulk, shred, loose fat (im not even sure of the difference between these) to get rid of it the most ?

I can eat anything, i have no problem with eating same food everyday (i did it for almost 7 months), i just need someone to help me mostly with my macros in order to achieve my goal.

Right now, i would say that my macros are about 40-45% proteins, 25-30% carbs, 20-25% fat. 

I had a measurements/ BF% appointment 2-3 months ago, i can provide the stats if necessary. BF% was 14,8% (?!) w/o visceral fat.

Poor man's rich soup.,"This is something I made and my family loves. Here's my recipe for poor man's rich soup, I make it in a large quantity for LOT'S of leftovers. It's also something I usually make in the cooler months since it's pretty heavy and warms your belly.



Poor man's rich soup;

1, 1 **litre** can of Campbell's mushroom soup.

1 whole chicken.

2 heads of broccoli.

1 whole bunch of asparagus.

2 garlic cloves.

1 package of mushrooms.

Spices to taste. (I like salt and a little paprika, cayenne and garlic powder)

Preferred rice, however much you want to cook.



I first cook the chicken in a slow cooker with whatever spices you prefer, I like to use chicken spice. Once the chicken is done, take it out to cool a little and throw the can of soup now into the slow cooker. I like to do my veggies on a pan and fry them with the garlic, let the veggies  still be a little firm and then toss them in the soup. You can also boil them instead if you prefer. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle take all the meat off and rip it into bite sized pieces and throw it all in the slow cooker and your spices too. Keep it cooking on high for maybe another hour, just until it's all hot and done! Pour it over rice.

Obviously you can substitute pretty much anything, brussel sprouts are a cheaper alternative to asparagus but I wait for asparagus to come on sale since it's delicious.",EatCheapAndHealthy

What’s the go-to lazy meal for each time of day in your country or culture?,"I’m an American Jew. So for breakfast, we do an easy matzah brie or bagel with lox.

Developing A Muscle And Weight Diet,"Hello, to elaborate on the title I am trying to develop a diet where I will gain muscles (so muscle fat) and a diet where I will also gain some weight (muscle fat, not unnecessary fat)  


**Background:**  
Currently, I am 19 years old (almost 20) and I am around 110 pounds. You can easily see my veins through my skin, I'm not very strong, I get hurt easily and I'm trying to consume foods that will help me not only get stronger, but also make me gain some weight. I'm open to almost anything except eggs and all forms of nuts since I'm allergic.

For context on my current diet, usually, I tend to eat roughly every 2 hours, I just can't seem to follow the ""3 meals and a snack"" type of way of eating. Starting the day usually with about 16oz of whole milk along with a banana. Some snacks throughout the day include oranges, berries, baked potatoes with melted cheese, a sandwich (texas toast, pepper jack cheese, roast beef, beef bacon, baby spinach, mayo, and mustard). Closing the day off, dinner is varied, but once a week it's always rice.  On a side note, for dessert, I typically have some small pieces of candy and marshmallow which span at most the palm of my hand (it's not a lot). I also do end up drinking another 16oz of whole white milk before sleeping. Last key detail would be that once a week is eating fast food whether that be Burger King, or Chinese, or even just milkshakes

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals:**  
My goal is obviously gaining muscle fat and some weight, but I'm also trying to eat foods high in protein and low in carbohydrates. The reason being is that I feel for my situation that proteins might be useful while carbohydrates my hurt my current situation. Alongside this, I'm trying to eat foods that are easy to make, healthy, and delicious with a fridge and a microwave to work with. I don't mind putting in some work if that's what it means, but it shouldn't require an oven or any other cooking tools. Obviously, a cheap option is ideal, but at the same time, I am looking for something that won't be cheap and low quality like most things tend to be, I want to sustain the quality. I'd say the budget is $100/week but I'm willing to go a bit over if needed.  


**Advice:**  
So, what would be some good options for my current situation?",EatCheapAndHealthy

[No Oven] Never really learned to shop healthy. What are some healthy foods I should always have in the house?,"I've learned that over the course of the past couple months, I'm awful at shopping for food. I'll buy a bunch of items that I think will be great while I'm at the store, spend anywhere between $100-200, and then when I get home and put it all away and somehow it looks just like it did before I went to the store, with one or two additional items. 

We always have enough butter, eggs, coffee and creamer, rice, grits, ramen, onions, potatoes, mac&amp;cheese, chef boyardee, etc. I've always put the emphasis on getting pre-packaged food that lasts a long time because it's unlikely I'll be able to go to the grocery store every week, and we eat like we do because with foods like these, it's rare that a single meal will cost more than $2. 

My girlfriend and I recently moved across the country and food was the last thing on our minds until suddenly we were both so sick we couldn't leave the house. She was handling it and to her it felt like a mild hangover, but to me it was terrible. It literally felt like I could hear my earwax melting. Eventually figured all the sodium was making us dehydrated, so we chugged water for a while and within 24 hours we felt better, but we realized the way we've been eating for the past 3-5 years isn't really sustainable. 

What are some foods that contain a lot of nutrients? I know everyone says eat a lot of fruit and vegetables, but which ones are good? I was on a lettuce kick last year but then I heard there isn't much in lettuce that's good for you. My girlfriend also suggested we should start taking multivitamins because we might not be getting the nutrition we need, but someone on Reddit a couple years back said they might cause cancer so I don't know if that's a good idea. Similarly, when I asked my mom she said tofu is good for you, but I've also heard soy can cause testicular cancer, which I'm not about. 

What are some nutritious staples I should always keep on hand, that won't make us sicker in the long run?

"Chicken Paprikash. Incredibly cheap and delicious, healthy enough for a richer meal every once in a while.","Not the healthiest meal, but healthy enough and very cheap and delicious: Chicken Paprikash.

You're gonna need some staples up front to make this dish, which are about $10 overall, but once you have those, you can use them to make it about 4 times and only spend about $10.00 each time for about 8 servings.

First off, buy some paprika ($3, hot, sweet or original, whatever suits your tastes. If you like hot food, I'd recommend trying it with hot paprika), Lawrys seasoned salt ($3), chicken bouillon cubes ($2) and flour (large bag for $2). These are the staples of this dish that should provide enough ingredients to make it 4 times. That's $10 spread over 4 batches, and 32 servings.

Next, when you're planning on making the paprikash, you're gonna need one rotisserie, or  one whole chicken, depending on if you want to cook the chicken yourself ($5), One pint of sour cream ($2), Vidalia Onion ($0.50), and 4 eggs($0.50 per dozen).

Spread out over 4 separate batches, it's a base cost of $10, and $8 per new batch, including 8 extra eggs each time to eat with different meals as an added bonus. So right around $10 per batch, which will net you 8 very good, filling meals, at a little over $1 per meal.

Highly nutritious meals that are easy enough for a teenager to make?,"Hi everyone! I'm a teen that's currently on summer break that's been subtly tasked with looking out for my twin sister, who is also on summer break. She has issues with depression so during breaks she does nothing but sleep and idle around, often only eating a little bit of food once a day. My parents both have to work and thus aren't around when she usually wakes up (lunchtime-ish) and they expect us to feed ourselves; the issue is that my sister won't come down to eat breakfast or lunch and will, even if I bring food up to her, eat only a little (though she will, at least, eat something).


My idea to make sure that she stays at least somewhat nourished is to make meals for her that, even if she eats only a little bit of them, will be nutritious enough to sustain her more than, say, a slice of bread with cheese on it would.


That leads me to my question: What are some meals that are densely nutritious, decently caloric, and easy enough for a novice teen cook to make?

When I put the boiled kale into my bowl of cold water, a BUNCH of little white/ transparent floaters come off of it. They're smaller than sprinkles, more like crumb-sized. There are no floaters in the boiled water, so something is happening in the other bowl. I was using a plastic slotted spoon and a plastic bowl for the cool water, so I thought I might be ruining the plastic. **BUT when I switched to doing it with a wooden spoon and a glass bowl instead, the problem persisted!** And I don't think it's carried over from the plastic because it still doesn't look like there are any floaters in the pot I'm scooping from. 

I didn't see any floaters when I blanched all that kale with my friend. Her kale was all farm-fresh, whereas mine comes from a packaged bag at a grocery store. But it says it's prewashed, and why would there be anything like wax on it?? This is the second batch of bagged kale I'm trying this with. I ate all the other kale and felt okay, but now I'm thinking maybe I shouldn't have and I'm afraid to eat this batch.

I didn't see anyone asking this question on google or on this sub specifically. I hope someone can help!",EatCheapAndHealthy

Lazy but tasty no-cook black bean corn salad.,"It's hot outside (and in my house), so I really was not feeling like turning on my stove to cook. I was hungry and close to ordering takeout but knew i'd regret it. So I browsed the fridge and pantry. 

I opened a can of black beans and a can of corn. Drained and rinsed. Dumped into a Tupperware container. Sliced up some cherry tomatoes, cilantro, and green onions. Squeezed in some lime juice, sprinkled some salt, and added a generous amount of hot sauce. Mixed it all together. Ate it cold with some mixed salad greens. 

Super tasty for such a quick, easy dish. It's not necessarily a full/sufficient meal, but I have trouble with my appetite when it's hot out so this was a good step for me, and way better/healthier/cheaper than takeout.

Would be great with grilled shrimp and tortillas.",EatCheapAndHealthy
Cheap and Healthy for RV living?,"What are some cheap and healthy meals that I can plan for my husband and I? 

Due to life and situations beyond our control, we’re living in an RV currently. We have no water, and no refrigerator/freezer. What we do have for cooking is a microwave, an air fryer, a coffee pot, and we were just gifted a crock pot!

We occasionally have access to a full kitchen but the property were residing on is not ours. Same with a refrigerator/freezer. So we don’t have *alot* of room to stock up, but we do have some.

Recipes I’m thinking that would be ideal: something that has the same meat/veggie base, that can be reused throughout the week. We were both vegetarians prior to this living arrangement, so veggie recipes preferred but cheap meat dishes are also okay! Things we’ve made so far that have worked include anything with chickpeas, a large chuck roast that we reused throughout the week for sandwiches and  a stew (with carrots potatoes and beans), and ramen dishes with hot dogs and eggs. So it sounds like we’re not doing too bad but In between all that we’ve been going heavy on the junk food/processed foods and we’re just getting tighter and tighter with our money. 

I’d feel a lot more in control if I had some ideas thrown at me. Thank you in advance :)",EatCheapAndHealthy

Taco Bowl Meal Prep,"Made this [recipe](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/taco-bowl/) for my meal prep this week. I am loving all the flavors.  Please note, I roughly followed the recipe. I mostly customized it to my liking. 

It was overall extremely affordable. 

You’ll need:

Black pepper, Adobo, Sazon chili powder for seasoning,  and rice vinegar (optional). 

1 lbs lean Ground beef (93% lean 7% fat) 
(roughly $6-$8/approximately 1500 calories per pound)

Fire roasted tomatoes (under $2/60 calories per can) 

Mexican corn (under $2/90 calories per can)

Pinto beans (under $2/110 per serving/approx 350 per can) 

White rice (1 cup/200 calories per cup)

Lime (approximately under $1) 

I threw olive oil in the pan, heated it up and started adding the beef in slowly. I seasoned it with chili powder, black pepper, adobo, and sazon. Once the meat browned, I drained any fat and slowly began adding the canned ingredients. 

I started with the tomatoes. I plucked them out using a spoon, and used roughly half a can. I saved the rest of the can for next week. Next I added in the Mexicorn and beans. I did not drain the corn or beans, for added flavor. Just don’t put the entirety of the liquid in the pan or it will overflow.  (I also did not use the entire can, again, roughly half a can. Save the rest for next week.) Let this sizzle while the rice cooks.  

For the rice I made one cup of rice, with one and a half cups of water and half a cup of rice vinegar. I also added salt to the water. I squeezed in half a lime and cut a small sliver and cooked that lime IN the rice.  Let cook for approximately 10 minutes or until all the moisture has been absorbed.  Pluck the lime out and store. 

You can store the meat and rice separately or together. I choose separately for measuring purposes.  This is a very filling meal and cost approximately $12.

Edit: some Redditors have pointed out below that the calorie info is misleading. It is nearly 11 pm here. I will update in the morning.",EatCheapAndHealthy
Lunches that don't require refrigeration or microwave,"My biggest problem is going out for lunch. I get fast food every day because I'm not in the habit of packing lunches. I'd like to change this. I've done well in the past, but the problem is, my job often has me out of the office during lunch time, and oftentimes I have very little to no notice. This makes meal-planning difficult because I can't know for sure if I'm going to actually be in the office at lunch time on any given day. 

Every time I've gotten into a rhythm of bringing my lunch to work and throwing it in the refrigerator every morning, I have a job spring up that throws my rhythm off because at times I don't have access to a microwave or refrigerator anymore. I often have no choice but to get lunch out in those situations because I can't just pack the night before and have a refrigerator to throw it into the next morning. 

Other than that, lunches out tempt me because A) I much prefer hot food to cold food, and B) I need to get out of the office during lunch. I like to use that time not just to eat, but listen to music/podcasts and have that nice little private recharge time. Eating lunch in the office just feels like I haven't had a break at all.

B) is easy to counter, because even if I pack a lunch there's no reason I still can't leave and drive to a nearby park or something. So I have a plan for that.

A) is something I'm going to have to work on. There's really no reason that I have to have something hot every day at lunch. That's an adjustment I'm going to have to make.

But I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations on meal-prepping good lunches that don't require refrigeration or a microwave. If they do require it, are there any lunch containers you know of that do a really good job of keeping things safely cold for the morning? The standard lunch bags with those thin layers of insulation I don't imagine do the job.",EatCheapAndHealthy

Some apple cider vinegar receipes,"

Apple cider vinegar and cinnamon drink is a simple beverage recipe that takes only minutes to prepare and includes simply two easily accessible ingredients. 

As the name suggests, you’ll need 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar,  1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder, and a cup of water.

Add the cinnamon powder to water and boil it. Let it cool to room temperature. Add apple cider vinegar. Stir the mixture well and drink it.

### [Apple Cider Vinegar And Green Tea](https://applecidervinegarweightlossdrink.com/apple-cider-vinegar-and-green-tea/)

Apple cider vinegar and green tea takes only minutes to prepare and provides warmth unmatched by any other drinks.

Boil a pot of water. Then add the green tea leaves. Steep it for around three minutes. Pour the tea into a cup and add the apple cider vinegar. Stir well and drink.

### Apple Cider Vinegar Salad Dressing

Salad dressing can decide if your salad tastes good or bad. You can use your daily quota of ACV to prepare a light salad dressing.

You’ll need the following ingredients:

* 1 small shallot 
* 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* ¼ cup cider vinegar
* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
* 2 teaspoons honey
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper

Mix shallot, oil, apple cider vinegar, mustard, honey, salt and pepper in a blender or mini-prep or with an immersion blender in a large cup until smooth, about 30 seconds. Use immediately or you can store it in a sealed jar in the refrigerator up to 1 week. Serve it at room temperature.

### [Apple Cider Vinegar Smoothie](https://applecidervinegarweightlossdrink.com/apple-cider-vinegar-smoothie-recipe/)

Among the many apple cider vinegar weight loss drink recipes, this is one of the trending recipes as it’s juicy and pleasant to taste buds.

To prepare ACV smoothie you’ll need:

* 1 frozen banana
* 1/2 cup frozen blueberries
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly minced ginger
* 1 tablespoon chia seeds
* 1 tablespoon almond butter
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* 5.3 oz container plain almond milk yogurt (Silk or Kite Hill)

Place all the ingredients in a blender, and mix until smooth. Your smoothie is prepared. Drink it immediately.

### [Apple Cider Vinegar And Fenugreek Seeds Drink](https://applecidervinegarweightlossdrink.com/apple-cider-vinegar-and-fenugreek-seeds/)

You’ll need a cup of water, a tablespoon apple cider vinegar, a tablespoon fresh lemon juice, and a half teaspoon ground cinnamon to prepare this drink.

Once all the ingredients are in place, combine all of them in a glass and stir well.

### Apple Cider Vinegar, Sweet Lemon &amp; Cayenne

Apple cider vinegar, sweet lemon, and cayenne drink is a variation of the classic lemon water drink. It tastes a bit sweeter than the classic lemon water.

For the sweeter tone, cinnamon is compromised, and cayenne pepper and honey are introduced. So, the list of what you’ll need becomes like this:

* 1 cup of water
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
* ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon honey

Combine the ingredients and stir well to enjoy a glass of ACV sweet lemon drink.

Put all the ingredients in a glass. Shake well.

Voila! You’ve got apple cider vinegar and molasses weight loss drink in your hand.

### Apple Cider Vinegar and Grapefruit Juice

Apple Cider Vinegar and Grapefruit juice is not only an incredible weight loss drink but also an extraordinary immune booster.

* 1 teaspoon of honey for taste 
* ice for chilled flavor

Mix apple cider vinegar and grapefruit juice in a glass. Stir it well. Add honey as per your need. Drink it immediately with or without ice.

Spend more at the grocery store if it’ll prevent you from eating out!,"For the longest time when I went to the grocery store I tried to only buy things that were the best value. I’d only buy the lowest priced regardless of what it was. This meant the lowest quality lunch meats, steaks, chicken, prok chops, bread, cheese etc. This caused me to always make excuses for why I needed to go out and eat. 

A few weeks ago I decided to spend a bit more on groceries and went to Whole Foods(mostly overpriced I know) I bought 2 steaks for my girlfriend and I and made them the following day. That was honestly the first time I’ve ever enjoyed eating steak at home! Instead of being disappointed in the meal and already thinking of excuses to go to Outback or something similar over the weekend I was excited to go back to the grocery store and buy another. Yes the steak cost me ~$3 more than what I normally spend on steak but $3 is a lot better than $40 at Outback. 

Basically if you’re like me and your biggest problem is eating out too much even when you buy groceries, start looking into high quality food. You’ll end up saving money from not eating out in the long run even if the grocery trip is an extra $20. 

TL;DR: Spend extra at the grocery store if it even prevents you from eating out once. That $40 you spent going out to eat will go a lot further at the grocery store.

Edit: I never said I thought Outback was actually a good steakhouse. I just used it as an example of some mid tier decently priced place to eat. I could have said something like buy better salad dressing to prevent you from wanting to go out and buying a salad. The logic still stands.",EatCheapAndHealthy

* Yogurt with fruit (I'm trying really hard to like Greek yogurt but can't get there yet...)

What I made with kitchen staples - one pot edition.,"http://imgur.com/gallery/lwRuW5I

I started out with these ingredients, all of which are pretty universal and stuff people generally have but use them for the same conventional recipes. 

* Can of chickpeas - £0.35
* Half a Jar of tomato cooking sauce - £0.35
* One medium onion - Approx. £0.10
* Some curry powder/spices of choice - Approx. £0.05
* Pasta - about 150g worth - £0.30
* Mixed frozen veg - Approx. £0.30. 

Serving size - around 3 hearty meals. £1.45/3 = £0.48 per serving.

What I did to make the meal: 
1. Fry onion with oil, I caramelized those bad boys up a little to add some flavour. 
2. Add your rinsed chickpeas, then add your spices. I used curry powder, paprika and chilli flakes. Cook for a little while. 
3. Add half of your tomato sauce, save half for another day to make spaghetti (use canned chopped tomatoes to bulk it back out again if serving more than one person). Salt and pepper to taste. 
4. Add enough water to cook your pasta in. I used around ~2 cups of water. Add your pasta and bring to a simmer. 
5. Cook for a few minutes, then add your frozen mixed veg. Mine was a mix of sweetcorn, carrot, green beans and tiny bits of cauliflower. I ended up using around 2 big handfuls of frozen veg. 
6. Cook pasta fully, salt and pepper to taste as you go along. 

Obviously, the list of veg and ingredients aren't exhaustive. I reckon veg like carrots and courgette would do great in this if it was grated and added last minute, or perhaps minced meat would do well in here if you eat meat. 

Happy cooking!",EatCheapAndHealthy
"Is it healthy to eat bagels and eggs every day? Looking for cheap, quick food options for lunch","I was curious if it would be ""detrimental"" to my health to eat an onion bagel and 3 eggs for lunch every day. I go home for lunch, but don't like to cook anything laborious. Takes about five minutes to make eggs and a bagel. To get 7.5 dozen eggs and 30 bagels, it costs about $18. This would mean I have lunch every day of the month for fairly cheap, but I'm not sure if it will be too unhealthy (since bagels are heavy in carbs, there aren't any vegetables, etc.). Someone I worked with advised against eating a bagel everyday, that it would be bad for me. Should I add something to the meal to mix it up? Or other lunch options for hot lunches that cost about the same (I don't really eat beans or rice due to texture issues)?",EatCheapAndHealthy

Super easy way to make rice taste better,"I’m sure a lot of people know this already but literally just add black beans, taco seasoning, diced tomatoes (I only add these sometimes) and sprinkle some lime juice on top. 

Put it all into a pan and mix it together with some water, if the rice is old, cover it and it’ll help re-steam it.

Used to take around 150 - 200 grams of rice in my lunches, now I take 80ish grams of rice with the black beans mixed in.  Healthier and wayyy tastier.

$5/Day Meal Plan (with vegetarian substitutes),"Ideal for those just trying to cut back on spending so much money on food, usually because you're eating out too much. These recipes are easy and you can always make them in advance to save time in the kitchen. For me, a fist-sized amount of meat/protein, veggies, and a carb like rice or bread are perfect, but of course - make each meal your own.

**Breakfast, 7 Days | Breakfast Burrito**

For 3 meals: 14 eggs, 7 tortillas, 3 Russet potatoes

I’m a big fan of grab-and-go breakfasts. This one takes some time to prep, but at least you’ll be able to sleep in a little bit longer in the mornings.

Add diced potatoes to a pan with a little oil or butter and cook them until crispy over high heat. While this is cooking, start scrambling all the eggs. Feel free to season your potatoes and eggs how you like. When they are both finished cooking, fill a tortilla with some of each, roll it up into a burrito, then stash them away in the freezer.

Each morning, just pop one in the microwave for about 2-3 minutes, and head out the door! If you have time to sit, try it with some salsa or chipotle mayo.

\*Note: Cool down your ingredients before constructing your burritos, this will prevent it from becoming soggy when you reheat.

**Lunch, Days 1-4 | Deconstructed Shish Kebabs**

For 4 meals: 3 chicken breasts, 1 bell pepper, 1/2 onion, 1 cup uncooked rice

Vegetarian substitution: mushrooms and tofu

Get started by cooking the rice according to package instructions. While this is cooking, dice the chicken into 1-inch cubes. Then cook this in a pan over medium-high heat. If you have a grill pan, it would be perfect. Season the chicken as you’d like; can’t go wrong with garlic salt and black pepper.

Next, dice the bell pepper and onion into 1-inch squares. Add them to the pan when the chicken is almost finished cooking, so they cook down a bit, but are still crisp.

Divvy this up into four meals for the week.

**Lunch, Days 5-7 | Crunchy Citrus Chicken Salad**

For 3 meals: 2 chicken breasts, 1/2 head of cabbage, 1 carrot, 3 clementines

Vegetarian substitution: feta cheese, spinach, and sunflower seeds

Cook and shred the chicken breasts, and of course, season to your liking. Shred the cabbage and carrot, then mix them together.

Serve the shredded chicken on top of the veggie mixture, with pieces from a peeled clementine. Eat as-is or pair it with a little sesame ginger dressing or make a simple garlic and soy sauce dressing.

**Dinner, Days 1-3 | Savory Pork Burgers**

For 3 meals: 1 lb. ground pork, 1/2 onion, 3 carrots, 4 thick pineapple slices, 1/2 head of cabbage, few pieces of green onion

Vegetarian substitution: black beans

In a bowl, mix diced onions, ground pork, salt, and pepper. If you have an Italian seasoning mixture, that would also pair well. Once mixed, form this into 3 patties. Place the patties in a cold pan with a bit of oil or butter, and cook it slowly over medium heat.

While this is cooking, cut your carrots into thick slices and boil them in water for about 7 minutes. Drain the water. Dice 1 pineapple slice and toss with the carrots.

When the pork patty is finished cooking, add a pineapple slice to the pan and cook it briefly (2 mins) over high heat. Serve the pork patty over the pineapple slice, with the carrot mixture on top of

a bed of shredded cabbage. Garnish the pork patty with chopped green onion.

**Dinner, Day 4 | Pineapple Black Bean Salad**

For 1 meal: 1/2 cup rice, 1/2 cup black beans, 1/2 cup corn, 3 pineapple slices

Get started by cooking the rice according to package instructions. While this cooking, drain your black beans and corn and heat them up over medium-low heat. Season this to your liking. I recommend lime and cilantro, if you have something like that on hand. Otherwise, garlic salt and black pepper will do.

Dice up your pineapple slices. When the rice is finished cooking, combine everything into one big salad.

With the pineapple being exposed for 4 days at this point, I recommend dicing up the rest and storing it in the freezer. We’ll use these pieces for the last 3 dinners.

**Dinner, Days 5-7 | Pineapple Chicken**

For 3 meals: 3/4 cups rice, 2 chicken breasts, remaining diced pineapple, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1 jalepeno, 1 head of broccoli, 1/8-1/4 cup of orange juice

Vegetarian substitution: fried cauliflower (should resemble chicken nuggets)

Get started by cooking the rice according to package instructions. Dice up the chicken breasts and add to a pan with a little oil or butter over medium-high heat. If you want them a little crispy, coat them in flour before cooking. When the chicken is almost finished cooking, add the remaining diced pineapple, diced jalepeno, 2 tbsp brown sugar, and 1/8 cup of orange juice.

Let this boil for a minute and the sauce will thicken up a bit. If it's too thick, add more orange juice. Serve the pineapple chicken over rice, with steamed or boiled broccoli on the side.

**Snacks, 7 Days | Banana Oatmeal Cookies**

For 7 snacks: 2 very ripe bananas, 3.5 cups uncooked oatmeal

Mash the bananas and mix them together with oatmeal. To this, you can add 1 tsp baking powder, cinnamon, chocolate chips, raisins, whatever you desire or what your budget allows.

Divide this into 7 cookies or 14 smaller ones and place them on a baking sheet. Bake this in the oven at 350F (180C) for 15 minutes. Flip them, then finish baking for another 5 minutes.

Once they're cool, you can store these in the freezer to keep for the entire week.

**Complete Grocery List**

* 14 eggs
* 3 Russet potatoes
* 7 tortillas (medium-sized)
* 7 chicken breasts
* 1 bell pepper
* 1 onion
* 1 cup (240ml) uncooked rice

Mild Meal Prep Tips,"My apologies for the format, I'm on mobile

I wanted to throw this out there for all my fellow clean eaters here who don't like to meal prep for an entire week. I personally don't like prepping a meal to have relatively the same thing every day of the week, and I don't have much time to meal prep a variety for the week. Here are a few things that have worked for me, so I wanted to pass on a few tricks from a broke and time-pressed student.

- When you're making something like a large salad to eat throughout the week, prepare everything but keep the compnents seperate. It makes it easier to switch it up and not eat the same side dish multiple days in a row.

- If you're cooking just for yourself, cook twice the amount you will eat, it takes marginally more time. Put half of it in a container, and bam you have one of your meals taken care of for tomorrow. Because of this system, My breakfast is simple (toast or oatmeal), my lunch is last night's dinner, and then I cook dinner and my lunch for the next day that night. Because of this, you'll have the same meal twice, but you don't need to commit to an entire week of it if you're strapped for time.

- Similar to my first point, keep an easy grain on hand and cooked. At the beginning of the week, I make enough rice or couscous to last the rest of the week. It takes little time, and because they can be prepared relatively flavorless, they can be thrown with *any meal*. You can get creative with it, and it's a guaranteed part of your meal that you needn't consider preparing.

These are just a few of my tips for some passive meal prepping and saving time. I'm also curious to see what you all in the community like to do for meal prepping without having the big sunday night meal prep?",EatCheapAndHealthy

Recipes with the specific ingredients given,"Hello, I’m a student and I’m looking to eat more healthy with the intentions of losing weight. I will also go for runs every night to help with this . I have been shopping today and brought veg, fruit, chicken, tuna and various rice packets. I have Philadelphia, salad and stuff like that

Today I’ve had a salad brought from Lidl’s, a slice of whole grain bread. 2 strawberries and 2 tomatoes. Child carton of OJ and an apple bake bar.

I have cooking a plain chicken fillet and some Mexican rice and that’s will do me today (Jokes I’m starving)

Do you have any good simple recipes that would change it up? I’m awful for sticking to diets due to non variety and everything being the same",EatCheapAndHealthy

"I am trying to eat cheap, healthy, and good for the climate. Looking for some pointers!","Hi! I switched to a more eco-friendly diet a few months ago, which for me basically means no more red meat (I count pork products as red meat too) and chicken/turkey/dairy only two or three times a week. I also try to eat fruit and veggies with low CO2 emissions (like even though it’s summer and all I want are god damn peaches, they are currently coming from Spain, or there’s the whole tinning process so it’s a no), and no plastic wrapping. I’m really struggling because the best place to get the locally sourced produce is farm shops but they’re so expensive. I’m also worried about keeping enough iron/protein in my diet. 

So my questions are does anyone here eat/shop similarly? Is it possible to eat cheap and healthy and seasonally? Is there any way to easily find seasonal things in the market or am I doomed to fail? Vegetarians, how do you eat cheaply and keep a good nutritional balance? If you have any advice about any of this jumble of thoughts it would be much appreciated. Thanks guys",EatCheapAndHealthy

The Great Chili Thread: Is chili intrinsically healthy? What are your inexpensive healthy chili recipes? What healthy toppings or sides to you prefer?,"I *love* chili.  All types of chili with all sorts of spins!  I cooked my first pot of chili back in 2012 and I've been trying to fine tune my personal recipe about 2-3x a month since then.  Since trying to eat healthier, meal prep when possible, and be more frugal, I've really stepped up my chili game.  I always include kidney, pinto, and/or black beans (usually only one or two types, never all three), cilantro as a topping, a very little bit of cheese, and sour cream in addition the obvious things like seasonings, tomatoes, etc.  Here are the things that vary and that I'd like input on before I make tonight's chili:

\- Pre-made seasoning blends (which I almost always modify with more garlic powder and cumin):  Which ones are best?  I'm trying the ALDI chili seasoning tonight for the first time.

\- Adding taco seasoning to the chili--I feel like this is cheating and makes it something other than chili...  Maybe something like taco soup?

\- If you make your own chili seasoning, I'd love to hear about that too.  I typically have everything I need to make my own, I just have been let down by online recipes in the past and don't want to try.

\- Beef broth...  I would think DUH, but I've made some ""okay"" chili with high quality broth and baller chili with just water.  Thoughts/preferences/experiences?

\- Vegetables:  This one actually give me a great deal of trouble due to how expensive yellow, orange, and red bell peppers are compared to green bell peppers.  However, I found one of each non-green bell pepper in a package at ALDI today for $1.99.  At the second most inexpensive place I can find them, they're $1.79 *per pepper.*  I've also tinkered with adding things like corn and mushrooms.  I tend to like a lot of different peppers and colors (and keep the spice low because my fiance is heat intolerant, heh) and not like many other veggies other than legumes, onions, and tomatoes in the chili.  But I always feel like I need more?

\- What types of canned tomatoes?  I'm not really concerned with brand so much as diced vs. petite diced vs. stewed vs. crushed, with or without onions, garlic, and olive oil, etc.

If it helps, ideally we'd have our chili on the night it's cooked (duh! haha) then carry it to work for lunch for the next few days, however long the quantity lasts.  That's made certain things I've tried adding get a weird texture after a day or two (mushrooms) and has really played up the taste and texture of less-healthy ingredients (73% lean beef).

Note:  We prefer beef-based chili, although I made some pretty fantastic ground-turkey based chili for the first time about ten days ago.  That just added to our confusion!

15 year old lookin to lose weight for the summer,"So I just turned 15 and for this summer some friends and I are trying to lose weight together. My only main disadvantage against them is that my parents are divorced so each household of mine refuses to buy lots of food for me due to the fact that Ike only at their house half the time. So my question is what are your guys best recipes that I can make a large quantity of and then freeze and reheat easily, focusing on high protein, low fat, and low carbs, also no added sugars.

"I eat instant noodles twice a week, with eggs and veggies, would this affect my health drastically?","I wasn't sure where to post this, so I apologise if I'm in the wrong sub.

Basically, I'm a college student and I like to cut on my expenses here and there, although I do care for my food habits enough to prioritize spending on it.
I've always loved instant noodles, I like to eat it weekly, once or twice a week, I've been doing that for a long time, but recently I'm reading articles and just started being concerned about my health.
I eat instant ramen with 2-3 hard boiled eggs most of the time, I sometimes also add peas, carrots, corn, pepper whenever I have them stocked up. And occasionally when I'm feeling okay with spending more, some chicken breasts as well.
I don't depend on just noodles, during the day I also eat other foods such as cooked rice with fried potatoes, scrambled eggs, *Labneh* (iirc it's called Greek yogurt?), Normal yogurt..etc
I do also occasionally during the week treat myself to a couple of sardine cans, with lemons and pepper. 
And for snacks when I'm out or just want to eat something quicky; I opt for peanuts or raisins depending on how I feel.

So that's it, sorry for the bit long post but I'm concerned about whether continuing with eating noodles twice a week will give me future health problems, I looked up online but most of the results are people who eat it plain, no veggies, eggs..etc

Thank you for taking time and reading this, I appreciate it.",EatCheapAndHealthy

Big Batch Pre-Fried Rice,"This is something I've been making for a while now, and it's so ridiculously easy I thought I'd share it. Maybe there's a name for it already, but Pre-Fried Rice is the best I've come up with. It's similar to a pilaf. Fiddle with ingredients (mushroom, chilies, ground beef or pork or tofu, quinoa, egg, cabbage, etc) as you see fit, as this is more about technique than the recipe itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

1lb ground turkey -- $3

2 cups dry rice (plus water according to instructions) -- $0.50

1 bunch of kale or other dark leafy green -- $1

\~2 servings powdered beef bone broth -- $2 (the brand I use has 10g protein per serving, hence the cost)

1 onion -- $0.25

1T tamari or soy sauce -- $0.25

Dash of avocado oil or some other healthy high heat oil -- $0.25

&amp;#x200B;

Cook the ground turkey in a pot with avocado oil over medium high heat until the meat starts to brown. Add chopped onions and chopped kale. Keep cooking over high heat and let everything brown a bit. Add rice, powdered bone broth, tamari, and water (minus one tablespoon to account for the tamari). Then just cook it like you would rice. 

Now all you need to do is throw this in a hot pan and sear it quickly to serve. Using the rice as a rough gauge...2 cups dry = 6 cups cooked, so this makes at least 12 servings of an all in one easy meal of meat, carb, and veg for about $7.25 or $0.65 per meal. My bag of rice says a 1/4c is a serving, but I'm trying to feed you.

How do I avoid waking up hungry in the middle of the night?,"I hope someone else has experienced this problem. I eat pretty healthy, loads of fresh vegetables, mostly vegetarian dinners, lots of fibers, with three larger meals a day. Breakfast around 9-10 AM, lunch around 1-2 PM, dinner around 6-7 PM and snacks in between, like carrots with hummus, fruit and nuts.

However, no matter how full I feel after dinner and when I go to bed, I'll wake up hungry around 4-5 AM, and it's screwing with my sleep pattern, because I have to get up and eat something to be able to fall back asleep.  I'm a 24 year old female who weights about 70 kg and is about 172 cm tall, if that has any influence.

It may have something to do with my anti-depressants, since one of the side effects is increased appetite, but that doesn't really make it less annoying.Any tips are highly appreciated!

Edit: Holy sheez, this blew up. Thank you for all the advice! I’ll definitely be buying some Greek yogurt, make protein shakes,  eat more protein, drink more milk and try to sleep through the hunger :)

Edit 2: I ate some peanutbutter on whole wheat toast before I went to bed and drank some milk. Woke up less hungry than usual, mostly because I had to pee, drank some water and went back to sleep. Yay!",EatCheapAndHealthy
