How to make Chicken Jalfrezi | Indian Chicken Curry Recipe | Cook with Nabeela,,Cheap_Meals
California Poke bowl,"Ingredient quantities don't need to be precise. For four servings:

* 2 cups cooked rice -- white, brown, long grain, short grain, doesn't matter.
* 2 tablespoons vinegar (rice wine is more authentic but use what you have)
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 8 oz imitation crab flakes
* 1 cucumber, peeled and sliced thinly
* 1 haas avocado (optional, but I think it's mandatory)
* 1-2 cups misc ""salad"" vegetables (tomatoes, shredded carrots, peppers, green onion, pineapple or mango is surprisingly good)
* 1 cup shelled edamame
* Nori seaweed snacks
* soy sauce
* toasted sesame seeds
* sriracha (optional, my kids are wusses and don't like spicy food)

Cook the rice using your preferred method.

Break up crab flakes and sprinkle generously with soy sauce. Allow it to marinate while you assemble the other ingredients.

Prepare the edamame. I usually buy frozen edamame and microwave it according to the package directions. Shell it, salt it, and let it cool while you prepare the other ingredients.

Microwave vinegar, salt, and sugar until it is dissolved. Once the rice is cooked gently stir the vinegar mixture into the rice and let it cool.

Peel and slice the cucumber and avocado. Chop tomatoes, shred carrots, and prepare whatever other vegetables you choose.

Top rice with crab and vegetables. Crumple a handful of nori seaweed over it, sprinkle with sesame seeds, soy sauce and sriracha.

Rice is dirt cheap. ""Crab"" costs about $2.75. Cukes are cheap, less than a dollar. Avocado, prices vary wildly in my area but about $1.50 average. Frozen edamame, $1.75. Tomato and misc veggies are cheap, hard to spend more than $3.00. Nori seaweed snacks are cheap, less than $1.00.  Soy, sesame, sriracha I'm not counting because I always have that stuff on hand.  All in all I can feed a family of four for about $10-$12 and it's easy.

Bonus, my family are all sushi fans. It scratches that sushi itch for 1/10th what it would cost to go out to the local sushi restaurant, so really this recipe saves me about $90.00.",Cheap_Meals

Chicken &amp; cheese biscuits,"About 1/2 lb. chicken ($1), i can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of mushroom ($1 each), 1 lb of shredded cheese ($1-2), and 2 cans of biscuits ($1 each). $6 roughly for 8 servings. 

Cook cubed up chicken over the skillet, then roll out biscuits flat. Stuff and roll with chicken and cheese, then take the 16 rolls and stuff them into a lasagna dish. Bake per biscuit instructions. 

In a sauce pan, combine and heat up the soups. Dump the remaining cheese into this. Then pour this on top of the biscuits when they‚Äôre done. Made 4 meals for my bf and I since we took an extra serving last night. 

Sometimes we add mushrooms too. It‚Äôs a really nice comfort food and especially hits the spot in winter!",Cheap_Meals

Eating cheap and easy for a couple...,"I am pretty new to living on my own and grocery shopping, planning, and preparing my own meals. I live with my boyfriend, and I have been having a hard time with this aspect of it. We usually get food stamps (around $200/mo). I feel like we spend a lot on groceries and end up wasting a lot because it goes bad. I also don't have a lot of time to cook meals, most nights I only have about an hour. There are some meals I've made quite a bit...brats or italian sausage w/ boxed pasta salad, kielbasa w/ onions, peppers, and spaghetti sauce/noodles, spaghetti w/ meat sauce, tacos, those frozen OnCor Chicken Parmesan things, Vidalia Onion Burgers from WalMart and fries. My boyfriend is hispanic, so we also eat a lot of rice, beans, and hispanic dishes (tinga, al pastor, tacos). We usually buy the meat pre-seasoned at our local hispanic foods store. We also eats avocados quite a bit, which can become expensive. I usually buy the bags of mini avocados from Aldi.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to get better at planning for meals and making sure I have all the ingredients on hand, while also being more mindful about the money we're spending. I am pretty sure we will be losing our SNAP benefits soon because we ""make too much"" now.

&amp;#x200B;

We go grocery shopping pretty much once a week, but sometimes stretch it out to once every two weeks if we can, due to lack of time/money. We usually shop at WalMart and Aldi, and occasionally Kroger. When I buy produce it seems to go bad so quick. I don't know what I am doing wrong!

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for tips on buying groceries, and preparing meals fast for two people.",Cheap_Meals

Experiences with managers specials at grocery stores because of food nearing expiration?!,"Hi guys! 

Lately, I‚Äôve been noticing that many grocery stores offer ‚Äúmanagers specials‚Äù for products that are nearing expiration. For example, I‚Äôve seen meat, dairy, bread, and vegetable products for a discounted rate because they are a few days away from expiration. The managers specials seem to be an excellent way to get healthy food for cheaper. 

I‚Äôm a little scared to eat food near expiration, but these deals seem like the best way to get healthy food for cheaper. Any advice or experiences you can tell me about?

Thanks so much!! ",Cheap_Meals

Skewered Chicken Kebabs! [Part 1/2: the kebabs themselves],"So, this has been a pet-project of mine for the past few weeks, as I try to finish up my Indian menu for this sub. It's based on a recipe my mum used to use back in the days when I was a kid, but it's been adapted so that more people can enjoy this wonderfully delicious dish. 

[Here's a photo of the final product](https://i.imgur.com/veSKuz5.jpg) 

Ideally, this should take a day and a half for the best results, or seven hours at minimum for decent results (you want that marination settled in), or three hours for good results. And the best thing about this? You can convert the same basic idea for curries, burritos, and barbeques! 

But...! How much does it cost? Well, let's find out: 

#**What You'll Need + costs (where applicable):** 

* **Chicken** (whatever portions you like)l I bought a **300g** pair of bonesless, skinless chicken breasts (again! I know, it's a rip-off!) for this, and it cost me **¬£4.50**, but you can get this for *much* cheaper, especially if you break the bird down yourself. The only thing to keep in mind is that **the chicken should be skinless and boneless**. **Thigh meat is the best** to use for this. 
* **Yoghurt** I get a decent pot of **45g for ¬£1.59**, but I dare say you could get it cheaper. You'll only need two spoons. Use the rest for other things (I'll get to this in part 2). 
* **Onions (one white, one red), a capsicum (otherwise known as bell pepper, use the green one!) and a large tomato** effective cost: **about ¬£1.50** 
* **Garlic and ginger (a paste will do!), fresh chillies, a lemon, and coriander/cilantro (substitute parsley if you don't like the stuff)** I'll put the effective costs for all of these together up to **¬£2** for fun 
* **A spice mix (see below)** The costs for this and everything below are **negligible** 
* **Salt, pepper, sugar, malt vinegar, oil (one with a decent smoke point -- I use sunflower; mustard oil isn't good for you, but it's the best for flavour once it's been tempered), white pepper, MSG, and dried oregano** 
* **A cube/spoon of butter** (ghee is traditional; if you find it. Use it! But butter is *slightly* healthier, so be warned!) 
* **At least one egg** 
* **Chicken stock and corn-flour/starch** 
* **OPTIONAL: Soy sauce and chilli sauce** (a few drops of each will suffice) 

**Let's just round this up to about ¬£12 for FOUR portions, just because** 

#**The Spice Mix:**

I use my mum's home spice, which I've recently corrected after an intense conversation with her. It consists of: 

* 3 parts of toasted cumin seeds
* 1 part of dry chillies stemmed, ripped up, and toasted
* 1 part each of toasted green cardamom and cinnamon (like a pod of cardamom, squished, and a two-inch stick of cinammon) 
* A toasted bay leaf 
* Black peppercorns to taste (you can add this later) 

Stick all of this into a processor until made into a fine powder. 

ALONG WITH WHICH YOU'LL ALSO NEED     
(because I'm a spice fiend!) 

* A spoonful or two of any flavouring spice you know goes well with chicken; a tandoori masala, or any pre-mixed ""chicken"" masala will work just fine. [This](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rajah-Tandoori-Masala-400-g/dp/B004JNB6VQ) is hands-down the best pre-mix you can find on the market 
* Dried oregano (I added this in since I had some lying around, so I added it in) 
* A pinch of turmeric and a pinch of **kashmiri red chilli powder** comes *highly* recommended (these are both flavouring *and* colouring agents!) 

#**What You'll Need (utensils):** 

* A baking/griddle tray and foil
* A microwaveable bowl
* Two chopping boards and a knife
* A spoon and a fork
* Skewers (remember to pre-soak them if using bamboo!) 
* A little saucepan and an **optional** frying pan

#**What You Need to Do:** 

The most important step is the **marination**. There's a note at the bottom about the yoghurt. Please take a look at it. 

* Slice your chicken into chunky strips (say, half-an-inch thick widthwise per breast, cut the *really* large middle bits in half) and stab them all over with a fork, gash it here and there with your knife once in a while
* Nuke a spoonful of butter in your bowl on high for 30s or so until it's liquefied 
* While the butter's still liquid, add in some pepper, a pinch of flavouring spice, and leave to cool to room temperature
* Add in the chicken, all your seasonings and spices (reserve some of your flavouring spice for the end), a pinch of salt and sugar, the MSG, and some [smooshed garlic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y5h1pDHhzs), [minced onion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBj9H6z6Uxw), some ripped coriander, and a tiny finely-sliced green chilli
* Top with two spoons of your yoghurt, a whisked egg, a dash of lemon/lime juice, a dash of vinegar, a dash of oil, and any soy or chilli sauce you have (tabasco works great!) 
* Mix this thoroughly, cover, and leave in the fridge [to stew in the **juice!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP1vSIOmCc4) 

**Now**, you want this to sit for **at least** six hours, or **ideally** for about a whole day. If you're going to have it for dinner, make this up the last thing the night before. The tiny amounts of salt will cure the meat a little, and the rest of the flavours will slowly seep into the meat. Go take a break          
**But**, if you're pressed for time, you *can* leave this for a measly two hours. It won't taste amazing, but it'll still be pretty great. 

**NEXT!** 

* Cut up your capsicum and onions into thick chunks
* Soak your skewers for twenty-minutes if using bamboo; if not, take your marinade out for just as long to let it come up to room temperature
* Skewer your meat along with some good ol' vegetables like in [this messy, upside-down photo](https://i.imgur.com/64VMtno.jpg) (you can see how green capsicum would've made this look *so* much better), top with some salt, black pepper, and your flavouring spice
* Pre-heat your oven to the highest setting for 10 minutes or so
* Line a tray with foil and stick your kebabs on (I put some foil on there even though I had a oven-griddle tray since there's this one weird bit I can't seem to clean off it)
* Lace with a drizzle of oil and stick them in the oven
* Once they're in, wait for a minute, and turn your oven down to **Gas Mark 5**, which translates to about 190^o C/375^o F
* Go away (but don't leave your house!) for 30 minutes 
* Come back, turn your skewers over, and leave for another 25 minutes (of course, all ovens are different, so trust your nose)
* Now, all good? Slice off some cuts of lemon/lime, and stick them on top of your skewers. Leave this all for 15 minutes; otherwise, you can leave this for 10 minutes, and switch on your broiler for the rest of the time for a tiny bit of char (note, that you can leave this to slightly cool, and then stick it on a pan for a nice singe)
* Leave to rest for 5-10 minutes
* Finish by dragging the lemon/lime slices over the meat until the juice and the flesh comes off, discard the rest
* **Your kebabs are done!** 

#**Now what?** 

* **An important step comes next:** Put your skewers onto a nice plate, and cover them with some ripped-up coriander
* Take your glorious pan out of the oven, and spoon all those juices and bits off the bottom into your saucepan (put this on a medium heat)
* Add some chicken stock, a pinch of your seasoning spices, and a nice spoon of cornflour, stir this nicely together, and simmer for five minutes
* You've got a nice gravy-thingie! 

#**Serving [PART ONE]:** 

**Rice dish**

* Serve over plain or turmeric-coloured rice (boil your rice with a bay leaf, a dried chilli, seasoned water, and a drop of oil for the latter)
* Have a side salad in which you can stick your tomatoes and onions, you've also got enough to make a nice dressing on top

**Kati Roll/Egg-Chicken Roll** 

* Whisk an egg and pour onto a plate and season it
* Dip a roti/paratha/flour tortilla in the egg for a minute or so 
* Heat these up in a pan one after the other
* Once your bread is done, pour the remainder of the egg onto the pan and make a crepe out of it
* Make wraps/large tacos/burritos out of these, your cut vegetables, bits of your egg crepe, and some more coriander/cilantro, top with sauces

#**Yoghurt note:** 

First off, the more yoghurt you add to your marinade, the more of a ""gunky"" sauce you'll have clinging to your meat. I personally prefer this, since I was making rolls with this. Keep an eye on this. 

So, you've got all this yoghurt left over. What the fuck do we do with this? (This discounts the ingredients-list above) 

* Mix equal parts yoghurt and mayonnaise
* Add in some dried herbs (that dried oregano comes in handy right now), some seasoning, **two** drops of vinegar, a dash of soy sauce, some Kashmiri red chilli powder, and some sugar
* Mix in some chopped coriander/parsley
* You've got a kind-of a ranch sauce/raita thing that will work great alongside your spicy main! 

Enjoy! 

---- 

#**Pictures:** 

This is about it for part one, since I'll be doing something *very* different with this in part 2, but first...! 

[Here's a photo-series you can view!](https://imgur.com/a/NIgRU)  

I apologise, but I'm not the best at taking photos of what I'm cooking etc., mostly because I'm running around trying not to burn my house down.     
I do hope the images (collected from three different kebab roasts I made over three days with the same base marinade) give a pretty good idea of what we're doing. 

----

So, all of this should be good for four mains. I'd say that's a pretty good deal. 

In **Part Two**, we're going to convert these into lovely potato-ey ""cutlets"". I'll get around to posting that in a day or two. 

Hope you enjoy this recipe if you try it out! **:D** ",Cheap_Meals

[Chicken] Fake-i-yani! + sides! (Biryani adaptation),"(Picture series included at the end.)

So, while I've been away, stewing in my own juice, I've noticed an upswing in the number of South Indian dishes being posted here by users from that part of the world. It's a good thing, at the end of the day, seeing how [it's been a while (near-enough 14 months!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/5l88cr/oh_no_you_have_no_meat_is_there_a_truly_stellar/) since I posted one of my authentic-like Indian dishes here. [Click here for my full list, misses and all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/search?q=author%3Aionised&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all) 

And is this one of them? No. It's an approximation of one of my favourite dishes of all time: the undisputed King of Food, the **Biryani**. 

Now, I'm a [bit of a fanatic](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4adn5x/waiterswaitresses_of_reddit_what_is_the_most/d103r5l/) when it comes to Biryani (and I have perfected my arts since that comment). For the basics of what we're about to do, give [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUdcbCoIcA) a watch, since this guy has the art pat down. **However**, we're going to be using a *slightly* different method, here. 

**First things first:** We're *not* making a Hyderabadi biryani. We're making something halfway between a Hyderabadi and a Lucknowi/Bengali biryani. This is not *really* a biryani, since we're avoiding the saffron (and in my case, at least, using bonesless meat). 

Now, I'm not going to lie. I'm going to be sticking only a little to tradition, as well as maximising the amount of food yield. A lot of people make up recipes on the internet that claim to be biryani, and none of them are it. This isn't it either, but it's the closest you will get to that authentic Mughlai flavour from centuries ago. [Note: if anyone mentions tomatoes without the word ""Bhatkali"", disregard them.] 

# **What utensils you'll need:** 

* A wide frying pan
* A thick-bottomed saucepan with a tight-fitting lid
* A saucepan for your rice
* A bowl, a plate, and a host of paper towels
* At least one chopping board
* [ESSNTIAL] A spoon, a fork, a big old wooden spoon, and a pair of sharp knives (one for meat, one for veggies)

# **What ingredients you'll need:** 

(Specifically-priced) 

* **Chicken** (or any other meat as long as you can cook it properly -- you'll have to use your own judgement for this; this recipe will use bonesless chicken breast as the norm). I got **500g** of **boneless, skinless Chicken Breast** for **¬£4.50** (which is a rip-off. Visit your local butcher, or break down a bird yourself. The **bones are necessary** for a proper biryani. I didn't have any, so I used stock bouillon instead). 
* **Two large onions, one red, one white/brown/yellow**: should cost up to **¬£1** total
* **A large potato**: I spent about **30p** for mine 
* A **Garlic/ginger paste:** This is usually inexpensive, but if you can't find any, grate up some ginger and [smoosh up some garlic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y5h1pDHhzs). Costs? I spent **¬£1** 
* **One whole head of garlic**: I spend **¬£0.33** per head 
* **Greek Yoghurt**: I get a pot for **¬£1.29**, and I only use about half of it, including the add ons 
* **Basmati rice (best you can find)**: I have a local place that does **2kg for around ¬£3, you'll only need around 350g**. 

(Prices up in the air) 

* **Water, oil, salt, and pepper** 
* **A few bay leaves**
* **[Optional] A few chillies (both dried and fresh -- PLEASE leave the dried ones in)**
* **Cumin seeds** 
* **Spices: Turmeric, (Kashmiri, if possible) red chilli powder, cumin powder, and coriander powder** (If unavailable individually, buy any flavoursome pre-mixed spice you can find, just make sure you have a good amount of cumin in it. Bonus points for coriander powder!) 
* **Sugar** (you'll only need a tiny amount)
* **Butter** (this varies by location and availaility, of course)
* **A Lime and some (fresh!) coriander (or cilantro, as some of you might call it); substitute parsley for those who are not inclined to said herb** 
* **[COMPLETELY OPTIONAL] Plain flour** 
* **[IF USING BONELESS (fuck it, use one anyway if you don't have stock)] An appropriate bouillon cube** 

**TOTAL COSTS (rounded up with some imagination): ¬£10/11** for about **5 large meals per person** (I ended up making enough for seven, so... this might yield a lot more than I thought.)

**Special Note:** My mum makes a **home-spice** which I use in everything. The base composition is **2 parts toasted and ground cumin seeds**, **1/2 measure of pre-ground cumin powder**, **2 parts each of: bay leaf powder, kashmiri red chilli powder, and ground black pepper**, and **1 part each of turmeric powder and coriander powder**. 

#**What you'll need to do:** 

This is where the work comes in. It might seem like a lot; but trust me: this is a one-cook solution to a *lot of food*. And the best part of this? You can make this twice a week if you live alone or in a two-person household, this will be totally worth it. It'll last **3 days in the fridge** 

#Step One: browned onions and early potatoes

* Slice half your white onion into thin strips. Cut them in half, take the skin off, and slice away. You want the slices even, thin, and long. Please don't cut yourself. Break them into individual pieces 
* Oil your pan, let it come up to a medium-high heat, and drop your onions in with a pinch of salt 
* Akin and quarter smaller potatoes, if using a larger one, cut it into around 1"" sized bits, sprinkle and toss with salt and turmeric
* Stir the onions around until they start browning. Chop up a clove of garlic on the side into thin strips. Rip up a tiny bit of coriander
* When they're going crispy (take smaller bits out early), take them out and spread out on a paper-towel-lined plate to dry in the air
* Drop in your potatoes into the same pan (add some more oil if you need any), stir and toss for about five minutes (do NOT leave this alone). You want these cooked at least half-through
* Add in your garlic and toss. When close to done, sprinkle over your coriander 
* Move your crispy browned onions to a side and slide your potatoes next to them, sprinkle with some salt. Cover and leave aside. 

#Step Two: marination and ""the soak""

* Add a few knobs of cubed butter into a microwaveable bowl, add fresh-cracked pepper, and stick it in the microwave for about a minute. Don't be scared. It'll crackle a bit. Leave this to cool for five minutes or so
* Boil some water up with a pinch of salt, leave it to cool a little. Wash your rice thoroughly, and add it in to soak
* Cut up your meat (leave it out until it reaches room temperature first) to your desired size, and add it to the bowl with about a third of your spice mix, a third of your browned onions, a smoohsed clove of garlic, some coarsely chopped garlic, a heavy spoon of your garlic/ginger paste, a tiny pinch of sugar, some lime juice if available, a chopped fresh chilli if using one, and enough yoghurt to evenly coat the mix. Mix well together. Go sit down for an hour. Patience is key. **If you can, do this marination thing the night before and stick it in the fridge, covered, for the best results** A bit of [*very* finely chopped onion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBj9H6z6Uxw) will also help 
* Now, I mentioned flour earlier. If you want a teensy bit of a crunch on the surface of your meat, dredge the pieces through some plain, seasoned flour before you add it in to the mix (comes later), but this isn't traditional
* Go have a drink and watch an episode of your favourite TV show. 

#Step Three: final prep

* Chop up the rest of your onions (dice, slice, doesn't matter any way but how you want them done in the end). Finely slice your garlic. Chop up two fresh chillies if using them. Spring onions/green onions (not included up above) may be added, if you wish
* Strain your soaked rice. To your secondary saucepan, add some water, salt, your bouillon cube, a pinch of turmeric, about ten cumin seeds, your spice mix, a ripped-up bay leaf, and at least one ripped-up dried chilli, with a glug of oil. Start a low heat, and leave aside. You may crack some black pepper on top as well, if you wish

#Step Four: cooking it

* To your heavy-bottomed saucepan, start a medium heat, add some oil, and drop in your cumin seeds (I'll say, 5 seeds for every 100 grams of meat), 1 ripped-up bay leaf per 200g of meat, and the same amount of ripped-up dried chillies (unless they're super-sized) 
* When the cumin begins to pop, add a decent knob of butter, stir it around, and (carefully!) slide in your onions
* Sitr, and reduce the heat to low. Keep stirring for two minutes, and slide in your smooshed garlic and chopped chillies, stir, and spoon in another handsome spoon of your premade paste. Stir aggressively together, reduce the heat to low, and cover for another two minutes 
* Open it up, add a sprinkle of your remaining spice mix with some salt, increase the heat to high, and stir. When everything's getting nice and dry and fried, slide in your chicken. All that stuff left in the bowl? Keep it on hand 
* [The above step is known as the ""kosha"" in Bengali, which basically means a dry-ish fry with toasted spices, far as I know]
* Depending on how much meat you have, you might have to stir to ensure that everything is meeting that dried/fried stuff at the bottom 
* When you see the meat colouring on all sides (you'll have to stir more aggressively with red meats), sprinkle over some more spice mix, and some browned onions
* Stir and layer over one third of your rice (the rice should be 1/3^rd cooked at this point), make sure it seals the whole mix beneath. You are **not** touching that from this point on
* Chop up some coriander, sprinkle over some browned onion, some of your coriander, and a few cubes of scattered butter
* In that bowl of marinade? Drop in some hot water (ballpart estimate: 150 ml), mix it all down, and add a pinch of salt
* 5 minutes after your last layer, drop in half your marinade water, and start arranging your potatoes around
* Do another layer of spices (the rest of it)/rice/browned onions/coriander/butter
* Add in the rest of your mariande water, and do another layer 
* If it looks too dry (you have to eyeball this) drop in more warm water, butter, and a sprinkling of whole stalks of coriander
* Top with some sliced chillies if you wish, and some fresh coriander
* Cover it tight, and leave on a high heat for at least fifteen minutes (if you hear a sizzling noise, stop immediately!). You want the bottoms roasted against the onion/garlic/ginger mix, and the tops tenderly boiled. This is a little about trust. Don't walk away, stay around and keep an ear out. For large, whole pieces of chicken, you might need more time
* Let it rest for 10 minutes
* Go have a drink, wash up, and calm down. 

#Step Five: Serving 

* Make a vertical wedge, scoop up and on to a plate, upside down, so that the meat goes on top 
* Finish with a topping of herbs and any seasoning you wish
* Hang on a minute! Didn't we buy all that yoghurt?! What are we supposed to do with that, now?! Well, you can always make something I've usually hated until I made this dish last night: **RAITA!** (which is traditional). **Add two heavy spoons of yoghurt, mix it with a heavy dose of coriander/parsley, add a dash of salt, chilli powder (I added some Himalayan Pink Salt), and a tiny pinch of sugar before mixing it all together. If your fake-i-yani is spicy, this will calm it the heck down. Why I've hated this for so long, I have no idea 
* Add a boiled egg to this 
* Simple pickled onions (thinly sliced red onion, malt vinegar, salt, sugar, and a dash of flavouring spice, left covered for an hour) is a great topping 
* Make a simple green salad side, or dress with some blanched simple vegetables 
* Guacamole is a surprisingly good side with this, as well. Who'd have thought of it?! 

#Step Six: Traditions

* Chicken biryanis are usually paired with mutton (goat) biryanis, and vice-versa, but since we're working on the cheap, don't bother 
* The oil most commonly used in Bengal is mustard oil, which is delicious, but not particulary good for you. It's usually kept out of biryanis. I use sunflower for this 
* Top the last remains with a simple lentil soup and mix together for a sort-of ""khichuri"". 

----

So, in the end, we've got a huge amount of food. It might sound like a lot of steps, but once you've got the method down right, it should be fairly easy. You're brave. Don't let the food dominate you. You own it. You're going to eat it. 

Indian cooking is a lot about being intuitive, so taste as you go apart from the raw chicken. Watch the video I posted above for the basics, and apply similar techniques following the steps I've posted so far. 

If you let it cool to room remperature, this'll last three days in the fridge. 

To **reheat**: add a serving to a microwaveable bowl, sprinkle with a few drops of cold water, zap for 2^1/2 minutes on High (800W), let rest for a minute, and zap again for 3 minutes on Medium. 

If you don't have a microwave, add a tiny amount of oil to a pan, and stir-fry until the rice starts crisping up. 

[Here's a picture-series of what I did (differences were made).](https://imgur.com/a/IqfuJ). I messed up by dropping my marinade-water in too early since I was too busy talking into my phone like an idiot, but the **best thing about this mistake is**: you've just set up a curry! Bring it to the boil and simmer down until it's done. I added some spring onion since I had some lying around and ended up blowing even my head off with the spices (hence the raita). 

#**Differences from the original meal:** 

* Meat should be on the bone
* One side roasted, one side boiled/stewed with the blend of flavours
* The best basmati rice ever is what this deserves
* Only the Bengali variant should have potatoes in it
* Saffron-milk is the *only* topping in a *true* Biryani (too expensive for regular meals)
* A complementary meat-based side dish
* Ghee, not butter (but nuking butter in a microwave is a decent enough substitute) 

---- 

#So there you have it! 

The fake biryani-like dish that'll feed you for a good long while. A simple raita works well as a side dish to *any* spicy/rich dish.

"I return, triumphant! With... slop! (Plus, an update on year-old community project!)","Following the disaster that was my [community project idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/5mwhnf/proposition_for_a_community_project/?st=jce5nr25&amp;sh=29877f8f), I have not been in the kitchen, as much. But now, I return, triumphant! 

Once a month, every month, I'll do the menu myself. 

But today... I have a sad old recipe to share with you. I call it the breakfast slop (in the night-time). Just a few minutes ago, I realised I was too drunk to make my epic chicken and rice (which would've been my return post, otherwise), and I threw together a strange slop of random food to fill my belly until the shop opens in the morning. 

And here it is: 

**What you'll need:** 

* A packet of some shit ramen 
* A clove of garlic (minced)
* Water, salt, and pepper
* An egg
* A tin of cheap baked beans
* Chilli sauce (optional) 
* A bouillon cube of your choosing or a flavouring spice (optional)
* **EXTRAS:** Oil, bacon, onions, and herbs (not dried)

As you can see, this is bottom-of-the-barrell stuff. Just **don't** use a non-stick pan for this. 

**What you need to do:**

* (If using bacon, chop it up, fry it off in some oil, and retain the meat for sprinkling on top, you may fry any onions in the fat with a pinch of salt before adding water) 
* Water in the pan (a bit more than recommended for your ramen), plop your stock cube in there (if using one) 
* Crack some black pepper in and drop in your (minced) clove of garlic 
* Let it come up to a rolling simmer and drop your packet of ramen in
* Bring to the boil and crack an egg in, whisking away 
* Add your flavouring spice in if using any at this stage, while whisking 
* When your ramen is beginning to soften, lace it with chilli sauce to taste and drop in your baked beans 
* Stir aggressively together 
* When you feel things begin to stick a bit, switch off the heat and keep stirring until you feel nothing adhering. 
* Let it be for two or so minutes
* Cover with any herbs you have lying around 
* Add the flavouring which came with your ramen and stir it together, add salt and pepper to taste if it seems bland (I doubt you'll need this) 

**And there you have it!** 

A disgusting-looking, alright-tasting, slop that'll keep you full for a good few hours. 

**How much did it cost me?** 

* 39p for the ramen
* ¬£1/6 for the egg
* 35p for the crap, cheap baked beans
* Everything else is a bit up in the air, but it doesn't round up to much 

**How did it taste?** 

It was okay, but by MPW, is it ever filling. I highly recommend this with a strip or two of bacon chopped in. It really is quite the hangover-curer. ",Cheap_Meals

Cheap Winter Produce,"Happy New Year to those who use the modern Gregorian calendar. Here's to another year of affordable, delicious meals that fill the belly, nurture the body, and are light on the wallet. 

While for many December is a time of understandable indulgence and enjoying of foods shared with friends and family, January has become associated with a refocusing on nourishment, health, and vitality, if not penance for the sins of holiday sweets and treats. There are myriad diets and fads and nutritionists and dietitians telling us a thousand and one different things about what foods are healthy and what foods are not, but common among most of the best advice is that we should all be enjoying a variety of fresh produce in our diet. While it is the case that sometimes produce can be expensive, one way to deal with the higher cost of fruits and vegetables is to shop in-season, to take advantage of the abundance of seasonal foods. 

Here are a few fruits and vegetables to be on the lookout for at your local grocery or market, which should be fresh and relatively inexpensive: 

* Brussels Sprouts: while children of our youth may have feared the flavor of over-boiled, margarine-coated balls of yuck, we all know better. Brussels sprouts, cleaned, halved, blanched for 3 minutes and then cooked in a hot iron skillet with olive oil, salt, pepper, and perhaps some lemon zest will brown and become deliciously savory and can make for an excellent lunch, can be added to salads, or can be a favorite side-dish for dinner. For a little extra seasonal flourish, look for sales on chestnuts, which can add a little nutty, starchy flavor. 
* Buttercup Squash: much like it's close relatives the pumpkin and the acorn squash, buttercup squash has hard flesh which can become sweet and mushy when cooked (boiled or baked). Simply cut open, remove and save the seeds for baking in oil later, and you can add a little butter, pumpkin spice, and apples for a healthy and warm baked dessert without too much guilt. 
* Cherimoya: a South American plant that often is found in so-called ethnic markets, considered to be one of the most delicious fruits in the world, these can make for incredible pie filling, will add a lot of flavor to smoothies, or can be cleaned and eaten like an apple. If you find these cheap, don't hesitate.
* Chestnuts: while chestnuts are a bear to cook and peel, they're well worth the effort if you can buy them in bulk and from a local grower. They're far more starchy than other nuts, having a texture not unlike starchy root vegetables, and can add a wintery flavor to any number of dishes. 
* Clementines: a hybrid between mandarin oranges and sweet oranges, these are deep orange and sweet citrus fruit similar to tangerines. They keep for a good week and are a wonderful snack, so buy in bulk. 
* Collard Greens: a long-held favorite of the American south, collards are dark green leafy vegetables which are quite rigid and hearty, but can be cooked (not unlike kale) into something soft or into chips. I prefer them with either ham hocks or smoked turkey leg, garlic, and served with hot sauce in a soup, which is traditional, but collards can be substituted in any number of traditional kale dishes. 
* Date Plums: these are a type of persimmon native to Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and can be made into jams, pies, added to fruit salads and smoothies, or are great on their own. 
* Dates: a classic sweet, dry fruit, in modern cooking these are often used as a way to add sweetness to smoothies and baked goods in place of refined sugar. They are very high in sugar, but also in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. If you find these on sale, don't hesitate. 
* Delicata Squash: these have become very popular recently, given they're easy to cook and have a flavor comparable but often considered even better than butternut squash, tasting almost like sweet potato. 
* Endive: a wonderful, classic light-green leafy vegetable which is light and sweet. I'm partial to endive savory slaw, but they can be used in any number of meals. 
* Grapefruit: use salt, not sugar. Trust me. 
* Kale: need I say more? Kale has been the superfood of the moment for the last 5-10 years, hailed for its incredible nutrition. But it can also be delicious! Alton Brown's winter vegetable soup sees kale become a vehicle for delicious vegetable broth, and you can bake kale chips for an alternative to potato or tortilla chips. 
* Kiwifruit: Sweet and fuzzy, not unlike myself. Great on their own, in fruit salads, or in smoothies. 
* Leeks: not quite the same as onions, but closely related, leeks have a more mild and sweet flavor than onion and are incredible in soups. I use them in winter potato soup. 
* Mandarin Oranges: see Clementines, these are also a small citrus fruit. 
* Maradol Papaya: a refreshing tropical fruit which is one of my favorite additives to smoothies. 
* Oranges: I mean, they're oranges. You get it. 
* Passion Fruit: perfect for adding to loaves and other confections, passion fruit is a nice alternative to traditional fruit like raspberry, strawberry, or apple. I like to make a passion fruit glaze for baked chicken. 
* Pear: I mean, it's pears. 
* Persimmons: see Date Plumbs
* Pomegranate: carpe Pomegranate, because these go out of season soon. Pomegranate are little bursts of sweet, dark juice that can add sweet tartness to anything from salads to smoothies. 
* Pummelo: gotta be honest, I've never tried this citrus fruit before. If it's available in your area for cheap, consider it an experiment. 
* Red Banana: no, they have not gone bad. Rather, they're a great way to cheat the system and enjoy a traditional summer fruit in the colder months. Red banana is sweeter than plantain but slightly less sweet than your typical yellow banana. They're similar to the way bananas were 50-70 years ago. They're often not cheap, so watch for bulk sales. 
* Red Currants: a wonderful winter berry that can add a lot of flavor to savory dishes, smoothies, salads, or baked goods. 
* Sweet Dumpling Squash: similar to Buttercup Squash
* Sweet Potatoes: the king of winter vegetables, as far as I'm concerned. Sweet potatoes are starchy but also incredibly sweet and flavorful, these are my go-to to carb up before exercise and to refill my glycogen at dinner after a hard day. 
* Tangerines: see Clementines, these are also a small citrus fruit
* Turnips: these are root vegetables can be added to salads, cooked in stews or, my favorite, pickled so they can last for months. ",Cheap_Meals
